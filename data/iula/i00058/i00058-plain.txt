How to Use This Manual

Introduction

NetWare Client TM for DOS and MS Windows User Guide has three purposes: to help you set up and install your client software, to help you set up and connect your client workstations to the network, and to introduce client User Tools for managing access and connections on a NetWare network.

This manual is for users and supervisors new to NetWare client networking and for network supervisors responsible for setting up and managing NetWare client workstations.

This manual covers concepts and procedures for installing and using NetWare client software on NetWare 2, 3, and 4 networks.
References are made to each version of NetWare.
Ignore any references which do not pertain to the version of NetWare you are connecting to.

Use NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for advanced setup and troubleshooting of your NetWare client workstations.

Documentation Conventions

This manual uses the following Novell xxx conventions:

Asterisk ( xxx )

An asterisk denotes a trademarked name belonging to a third-party company.
Novell trademarks are denoted with specific trademark symbols ( xxx , TM , etc.).

An ownership listing of all (Novell and third-party) trademarks cited in a manual can be found either on the disclaimer page in the front or in a "Trademarks" section at the back of printed manuals.
A trademarks list is also available in the DynaText xxx online documentation.

Commands

Boldface characters indicate items that you type, such as commands and options.
You can use any combination of uppercase and lower case letters.

For example: C:\A INSTALL 

Delimiter Bar ( xxx )

In syntax examples, a delimiter bar separating two command options indicates that you can choose one of the options.

For example: xxx 

Do not type the bar.

DOS Commands

DOS commands and command option letters are shown in uppercase letters.
For example: FTPD .

Because DOS is not case-sensitive, you can type DOS commands in uppercase or lower case letters.

DOS Filenames, Directory Names, and Pathnames

DOS filenames, directory names, and pathnames are shown in uppercase letters.
For example, xxx 

Because DOS is not case-sensitive, you can type these names in uppercase or lower case letters.

Ellipses

Ellipses in syntax examples indicate that parameters, options, or settings can be repeated.

For example, in the command LOGIN SERVER1/SUPERVISOR /option... you could replace option with any number of available options. 

Emphasis

Italic type indicates emphasized text.
For example:Remember to load the driver before you install the application.

Icons

Checklists, which often contain prerequisites, are marked with the "Checklist" icon to the left of this text.

Procedures to follow in order to accomplish a specified task are marked with the "Procedure" icon to the left of this text.

Additional or "nonessential" but noteworthy information is marked with the "Note" icon to the left of this text.

Vital information about system or software requirements, etc., that deserves particular attention is marked with the "Important" icon to the left of this text.

Guidelines or tips about fine-tuning, optimizing, etc., which might be applicable to your site or situation but maybe not to all, are emphasized with the "Suggestion" icon to the left of this text.

Warnings about potential danger to data, hardware, or person are emphasized with the "Warning" icon to the left of this text.

xxx means hold down the Ctrl key and simultaneously type the letter c (in lower case, in this case).

xxx File Section Headings and Parameter Settings

xxx section headings and parameter settings are shown in uppercase when used as a reference item and lower case when used in syntax or working examples.

For example: [Begin example] 

NETBIOS VERIFY TIMEOUT specifies how often in (ticks) NetBIOS sends a keep-alive packet to the other side of a session to preserve the session.

If no packets are being exchanged on the NetBIOS session by the software that established the session, NetBIOS sends packets at regular intervals to make sure that the session is still valid. 

Table

Syntax.
netbios verify timeout number, replace number with a number of ticks.


Default .


Range .


Example .
To make NetBIOS wait longer before sending a request-for-acknowledgment packet, you could place the following lines in your NET.CFG file: netbios netbios verify timeout 1350 .


[End example] Because interpretation of this file is not case-sensitive, you can type its contents in uppercase or lower case letters.

Options

In syntax examples, braces indicate that you are required to choose one of the enclosed options.
For example, the following notation means that you must include a 0 or a 1 in the command: xxx 

Square Brackets

In syntax examples, boldface type enclosed in square brackets indicates command options that you can type as needed. For example: xxx 

System Response

Monospace type shows system-generated responses that appear on your workstation screen. For example: NVT220 .

UNIX Commands

UNIX xxx commands are shown in boldface letters. For example, vi.
Because UNIX is case-sensitive, these commands are usually lower case.
Type UNIX commands exactly as shown.

UNIX Filenames, Directory Names, and Pathnames

UNIX filenames, directory names, and pathnames are shown in italics.
For example, /etc/hosts .

Because UNIX is case-sensitive, these names usually are in lower case letters.
Type UNIX filenames exactly as shown.

Variables

Italic type indicates variables---descriptive item names, such as command parameters---that you replace with appropriate values.

For example, in the command 

FTP -Fremote_host

you type the name of a computer on your network in place ofremote_host.

Basic Essentials

Overview

The NetWare Client TM software for DOS and Microsoft (MS) Windows provides basic connectivity and access to network resources for all of your DOS and MS Windows workstations.
In addition, it provides advanced networking services such as rapid data transfer, file and print management, and access to NetWare Directory Services TM software to effectively share and produce information.

The NetWare Client software has been redesigned to better support the increasing need for greater functionality and performance at the workstation for DOS and MS Windows environments.
The new design introduces a software component to the DOS environment known as the NetWare DOS Requester TM program.
The NetWare DOS Requester replaces the NetWare shell files such as NETX.COM. 

The NetWare User Tools program has also been redesigned to provide you with better access to and management of NetWare services for DOS and MS Windows client workstations.

Introduction

In order to take advantage of your NetWare client workstations, you need to understand how your client workstations relate to the NetWare operating system they are connecting to and to review basic networking concepts.

Users connecting to NetWare 2 and NetWare 3 TM need to understand how their client workstations relate to NetWare bindery server networks.

Users connecting to a NetWare 4 TM network need to understand the NetWare Directory Services TM (NDS) architecture and how it affects their environment.

Network Types

A network links two or more computers together to share resources and peripherals (such as disk drives, printers, and data).
There are two categories of networks: peer-to-peer and client-server.

Peer-to-Peer Networks

The simplest peer-to-peer network has two workstations connected together, each able to use the resources of the other.
All workstations on a peer-to-peer network are (or can be) equal.
No one workstation is designated as the main computer or central point of control.

Client-Server Networks

The client-server network has at least one workstation configured as a NetWare server.
As shown in Figure 1-1 on page 4, the server is a computer running the network operating system.
The server controls communication and shared network resources.
The client workstations are the individual computers connected to the network. 

Figure

A Simple Client-Server Network

Network Connections

You must make two types of connections to use shared network resources:

- A physical connection
- A logical connection

Physical Connection

In order for resources and information to be shared on a network, servers, client workstations, and other network devices must be physically connected.

Each device on the network must have a network board.
A cable attached to the network board provides the communication pathway, as shown in Figure 1-2 on page 5 .

Figure

Network Board and Cabling

The physical connection determines the kind of cable used, the way the cable is configured (called the topology of the network), and the way information is transmitted over the cable (called the protocol ).

Logical Connection

After the physical connection to the network is made, you must make a logical connection to access the network services.

To make the logical connection on a NetWare network, you must prove that you are an authorized user.
This is done when you log in to the network and provide the NetWare operating system your user identification and a valid password.
By logging in to a network or attaching to a server, you make a logical connection. 

Network Resources

After connecting to a NetWare network, you have access to physical and logical resources across the network.
A definition for each resource is maintained in a database used by the NetWare operating system.

An example of this is a print queue or group name.
How you interact with the resource database depends greatly on which version of the NetWare operating system you are running.

Resources for NetWare 2 and NetWare 3

The NetWare 2 and NetWare 3 operating systems use a flat database structure called a bindery for managing network resource definitions.
A definition for each network resource is maintained in the bindery.

For example, a definition exists for your user information, such as your username and password.
A bindery exists for each server in the network and is independent of resource definitions created on other servers.

The bindery structure for each server is flat, with a single location for accessing and managing network resources.
Therefore, when you use network resources in a multiple server network, you must be aware of their physical and logical locations in order to use them.

Resources for NetWare 4

NetWare 4 uses a global database structure called NetWare Directory Services ( NDS TM) for managing network resource definitions.
NDS treats all network resources as objects in a distributed database known as the Directory database .
This database organizes resources in a hierarchical tree structure, independent of their physical location.

The Directory database supports an entire network of servers.
Instead of storing all information on each individual server as in NetWare 2 and 3, information is distributed over a global database and can be accessed by all NetWare servers.

Users can access any network service, such as file services or print services, without having to know the physical location of the server that provides the service.

Components of a Directory Tree

NetWare Directory Services operates in a logical organization called the Directory tree .
It is called a Directory tree because objects are stored in a hierarchical tree structure, starting with the root object and branching out.

Three types of objects make up the Directory tree:

- Root object
The root object is placed at the top of the Directory tree by the installation program.

- Container objects 
A branch of the Directory tree consists of a container object and all the objects it holds, which can include other container objects.

- Leaf objects Leaf objects are at the end of branches and do not contain any other objects.
Volume, User, and NetWare Server objects are some examples of leaf objects.


The following figure shows how container objects and leaf objects make up the NetWare Directory tree.

Figure

Example of a Directory Tree

To refer to where an object is in the Directory tree, the term context is used.
The position of the object within its container is its context.
For example, in the previous figure, the context of User object Jody is Jody.Development.MedTech .

To identify a particular object, you must know its context.
To make it easy for users to locate the objects that they work with on a regular basis, you can set up configuration files to specify the context of each object.

This gives the users a more manageable view of the tree; they do not have to know exactly where each object is located in the tree.

The Structure of the File System

The bindery and NetWare Directory Services help you manage network resources such as NetWare servers and printers, but they do not provide control over the file system (volumes, directories, and files).
Graphical and text utilities help you manage both network resources and the file system.

The file system structure is separate from the bindery or NetWare Directory Services structure.
Physically, all network information is stored on hard disks that are controlled by a server.
But logically, the file system is represented in NetWare 2 and 3 as a volume and in NetWare 4 as a Volume object.
This volume is managed under Bindery emulation provided in NetWare 4.

Three types of structures make up the file system: volumes, directories, and files.

The File Structure for NetWare 2 and NetWare 3

The file structure in NetWare 2 and NetWare 3 begins with the file server.
The physical hard disks in a file server are divided into volumes, much like a set of books.
A volume can contain several physical hard disks, or a single hard disk can be divided into multiple volumes.

A volume marks the base of each directory structure.
It appears and acts like a DOS root directory or disk drive.

Directories are stored at the volume level and subdirectory levels.
Files are stored within directories and subdirectories in the same manner as the DOS operating system stores files.

The following figure shows how the file structure of NetWare 2 and 3 networks works.

Figure

NetWare 2 and 3 File System Structure and Directory Path

The File Structure for NetWare 4

The file structure in NetWare 4 begins with the Volume object .
A Volume object is one type of leaf object.
It refers to a physical volume where files are stored and allows NetWare Directory Services to locate files.

The root directory of a physical volume is also represented as part of a Volume object.
It is the highest level of the file system structure.
The Volume object provides a link between NetWare Directory Services and each physical volume's file system.

Directories and files are not objects in the Directory tree.
They are only a part of the file system.
Accessing directories and files within the Directory tree is done by opening a Volume object or setting up Directory Map objects.

You can make it easier for users to find files by setting up Directory Map objects that point to a particular location in a volume's file system structure.

The following figure shows how these structures make up the file system for a NetWare 4 network.

Figure

NetWare 4 File System Structure and Directory Path

The position of a file within the file system is its directory path .

To identify a file, you must know the context of the Volume object representing the physical volume that contains the file and the directory path through the file system structure, including the name of the file.

Network Users

Access to a NetWare network is possible only if you are identified to the NetWare operating system as a networkuser.

NetWare 2 and NetWare 3 Users

NetWare 2 and NetWare 3 allow for four types of network users, which have varying levels of responsibility on the network: 

Regular network users are the people who work on the network.
They can run applications and work with files according to the rights assigned to them.

Operators are regular network users who have been assigned additional privileges.
For example, a file server console operator is a network user who is given specific rights to use the FCONSOLE utility.

Managers are users who have been given responsibility for creating or managing other users.
Workgroup managers can create and manage users; user account managers can manage, but not create, users.
Managers function as supervisors over a particular group, but they do not have supervisor equivalence. 

Network supervisors are responsible for the operation of the whole network.
Network supervisors maintain the system, restructuring and updating it as needed.

NetWare 4 Users

NetWare Directory Services identifies the same network users as NetWare 2 and 3 do.
In addition, NetWare 4 identifies a User object named ADMIN.

The first time the network supervisor logs in, it is as User object ADMIN, which is created by default during NetWare 4 installation.

The term network supervisor in NetWare 4 merely refers to the person responsible for setting up the network.
NetWare 4 allows for multiple users to have supervisory rights---unlike the single supervisor required by NetWare 2 and 3.

When User ADMIN is created on the first NetWare 4 server installed, it can manage all objects because it has the Supervisor right to every object.
Initially, ADMIN can also manage all directories and files on every volume in the Directory tree.

User ADMIN does not have any special significance like the user SUPERVISOR did in previous versions of NetWare.
It is merely the first User object created and, therefore, is granted rights to create and manage all objects.

To use the network, every user must be assigned a User object in the Directory tree.
The User object represents the individual and keeps track of the person's use of the network.

Login

Before you can use any of the network services, you must attach to and log in to the network.

Bindery users log in to or attach to individual servers.

Therefore, they need a password for each server they are logging in to.

NetWare Directory Services users log in to the network.

Therefore, they need only one password to gain access to all network resources that they have the right to use.

Starting up and logging in from a client workstation always consists of the same tasks:

- Booting the client workstation.
This loads the NetWare Client operating system and is done automatically when you either turn on the power or reboot by pressing xxx .

- Loading the network software and drivers.
- Changing the default drive to a network drive.
- Logging in with a username and (usually) a password.
NetWare prompts you for your username and password and then completes the network connection.


The way users actually perform these steps depends on how the network supervisor has set up the network and the client workstation.

All four steps can be accomplished automatically so that the only thing users do is type their passwords.
For more information, see Chapter 7, "Setting Up NetWare Client Workstations to Log In," on page 161 .

For example, users can log in to the network by typing LOGIN ESAYERS or LOGINservername/ESAYERS .

LOGIN is usually executed from the AUTOEXEC.BAT or another batch file.
There is some difference in the command line syntax for the particular NetWare versions.

If you are using NetWare 3.12, see NetWare 3.12 Utilities Reference for a complete description of the utility.
If you are using NetWare 4, see NetWare 4 Utilities Reference for a complete description of the utility.

When users access resources on the network, background authentication processes in NetWare 4 verify that the users are who they say they are.

Once users log in to the network, their trustee rights in the bindery or Directory allow them access in the network.

Network Security

Security is vital in maintaining a productive network environment.
NetWare provides an extensive security system to protect the data on the network.

Network Security Levels

NetWare 2, 3, and 4 have three levels of security that can be used separately or in various combinations.

File System Security

File system security consists of rights security and attributes security.

Rights security controls what the user is allowed to access in and do to network directories and files.
Rights can be granted at either the directory or file level.

Rights security is administered by granting trustee assignments to objects and by acquiring effective rights through inheritance and security equivalence.

Attribute security assigns various characteristics to individual directories and files.
Directory and file attributes have priority over rights security and can prevent tasks that effective rights would allow.
Attributes can be used to prevent users from

- Deleting a file or directory 
- Copying a file 
- Viewing a file or directory 
- Modifying a file 
- Creating a new file 

Attributes can also be used to

- Mark a file for single-user or multiple-user access 
- Mark a file as modified so that a backup program can select it and leave unmodified files alone
- Protect a file from corruption by ensuring that either all changes are made or no changes are made when a file is modified 

Login and Password Security

Login and password security controls who can access the network.
The network supervisor uses login and password security to assign usernames to Understanding the NetWare Client Software.

Overview

Introduction

The core components of the NetWare DOS and MS Windows environment are four terminate-and stay-resident (TSR) programs, listed and described in the following table.

Core Components of the NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows 

Table

TSR Program.


Description.


Link Support Layer TM (LSL).


Puts the packaged requests from the IPXODI driver into the proper format for transmission on the particular physical network that the client workstations are running on.

Also takes replies for the various client workstations from the network (via the network LAN driver), removes the network-specific information it has added, and passes the reply to IPXODI.

NetWare DOS Requester DOS-based client software that provides the interface between DOS and the network.
It consists of individual modules that provide various network services.
It is loaded when you run the file STARTNET.BAT.
This file also loads drivers that the NetWare DOS Requester needs in order to communicate with the network hardware.

ODI TM LAN driver (MLID) (example: NE2000 TM) Takes requests from the LSL TM and sends them to the network.
It also receives replies from the network and passes them to the LSL software.
This LAN driver is specific to the network board installed in your client workstations.

Transport Protocol IPXODI (Internetwork Packet Exchange TM Open Data-Link Interface TM) SPX TM (Sequenced Packet Exchange) TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol)

Delivers requests and replies between client workstations and the network.
Also handles packet sequencing and acknowledgment for the client-server connection.

Takes requests that the NetWare DOS Requester has determined are for the network, "packages" them with transmission information (such as their destination), and hands them to the LSL.

When the NetWare Client components are loaded, each component uses a file called NET.CFG to determine the specific software settings it should use.
See Chapter 2, "NET.CFG Options Reference ," in NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for information.

The NetWare DOS Requester Architecture

The NetWare DOS Requester consists of a group of files that provide NetWare support for DOS and MS Windows client workstations.
These files consist of a number of Virtual Loadable Module TM (VLM) files and a single executable file (VLM.EXE) which manages operation of the .VLM files.

Full understanding of the NetWare DOS Requester architecture requires you to understand these components, as discussed in the following sections:

- Three-Layer Structure
- VLM Manager 
- Connection Table Manager
- Backwards Compatibility with NETX Applications

Three-Layer Structure

The .VLM files are grouped into the following three layers:

- DOS Redirection Layer 
- Service Protocol Layer
- Transport Protocol Layer

The following figure shows how these layers and modules fit together.
Individual pieces are discussed in further detail in the sections that follow.

Figure

NetWare DOS Requester Layers and Modules

DOS Redirection Layer

This layer provides DOS file services through the DOS redirector; its VLM TM program is REDIR.VLM.
REDIR performs all the DOS-specific callouts.

Previously, NETX provided its own file services; the NetWare DOS Requester uses the DOS redirector for most file services. 

Service Protocol Layer

This layer consists of the following parallel services.

Key Components of the NetWare DOS Requester

Table

Protocol Layer Service and Module.
Description.


NetWare Services NWP.VLM .
NWP, the NetWare protocol multiplexor, handles each particular network implementation through these child VLM programs: .


- BIND.VLM for NetWare 2 and NetWare 3 TM bindery servers 
- NDS.VLM for NetWare 4 TM NetWare Directory Services TM servers 
- PNW.VLM for Personal NetWare TM (NetWare desktop)servers
The NWP services also include logins and logouts, broadcast messages, and establishing and destroying connections.


Security Services RSA.VLM 
RSA (Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, developers of this particular public key encryption system) provides system-level background authentication for the workstation.
NetWare uses this encryption system to strengthen user authentication and access control functions.

File Services FIO.VLM 
FIO, the file input/output module, is a separate-but-parallel piece that implements a basic file-transfer protocol.
This includes cached or noncached read/write, burst mode-based read/write, and large internet packet read/write.

The Packet Burst TM protocol in FIO.VLM is based on Open Data-Link Interface interconnectivity strategy and is referred to as PBODI. 
This functionality allows users to choose performance over memory use and vice versa.

Print Services PRINT.VLM 
The PRINT module provides printing services using the FIO module for its file writes.
Print redirection is handled in the following ways, depending on entries in the NET.CFG file:

- Noncached
- Cached
- Via Packet Burst protocol to the server
- Via File Services (FIO)

Transport Protocol Layer

This layer is responsible for maintaining connections, providing packet transmissions between connections and performing other transport-specific functions.

The IPXNCP module uses the IPX TM protocol as a transport mechanism.

The AUTO.VLM module reconnects a client workstation to a server and rebuilds the workstation's environment---excluding file-specific items---to its original state prior to losing connection. 

Communication and Connection Management

The NetWare DOS Requester contains communication and connection management for controlling the NetWare client software.

VLM Manager

The VLM Manager (VLM.EXE) controls communication and memory issues between the individual VLM software programs.
It is responsible for loading the required modules and disbursing requests to individual modules.

Therefore, instead of loading NETX, EMSNETX, XMSNETX, or BNETX, the user loads only the VLM.EXE program.

The VLM Manager decides whether a given VLM program uses expanded memory, extended memory, conventional memory, or any other memory type supported, without affecting the individual VLM programs.

Connection Table Manager

The Connection Table Manager (CONN.VLM) spans all the layers of the NetWare DOS Requester architecture.

CONN allows client workstations running the NetWare DOS Requester to establish a configurable number of connections with multiple NetWare servers.

Backwards Compatibility with NETX Applications

The NETX.VLM program provides backwards compatibility with NETX and other older versions of the shell.
Therefore, you do not need to run NETX or other versions of the shell with the NetWare DOS Requester.

Nevertheless, because the NetWare DOS Requester is a redirector on the back end of DOS, it performs differently than the NetWare Shell software under specific conditions.

See "Compatibility with NetWare Shell Parameters" under "NetWare DOS Requester Option," in Chapter 2 of NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for more information.

The following figure shows a comparison of the NETX and the NetWare DOS Requester architectures.

Figure

Comparison of NETX and NetWare DOS Requester Architecture

The NetWare DOS Requester offers several improvements over NETX:

- Provides a modular architecture that has advantages for current and future applications.

- Takes advantage of memory-swapping technology and DOS redirection capability.

- Includes the Packet Burst protocol and Large Internet Packet (LIP) support.

- Supports the installed base of NetWare users by providing backward compatibility with NETX.

- Supports the NetWare Directory Services architecture in NetWare 4 software.


File and Print Services

Previously, the NetWare Client shell for DOS intercepted requests for DOS services.
At the client workstations, the NetWare shell (NETX) software hooked interrupts in front of DOS and provided network services for files and printing.

The NetWare DOS Requester takes advantage of DOS redirection to provide file and print services.
It also uses NetWare shell technology to add features to DOS and provide compatibility with applications that run on the NetWare shell software.

Memory Usage

The NetWare DOS Requester works with extended memory, expanded memory, and conventional memory.
When loading in extended memory, the Requester loads in LIM XMS 2.0 memory, not in the High Memory Area (HMA), meaning that extended memory can coexist with DOS loaded high.

The VLM.EXE program automatically selects the best possible memory use: extended memory first, expanded memory second, and conventional memory only in the absence of enhanced memory options. 

The NetWare Protocols and Transports

The NetWare software that allows client workstations to communicate and be understood on the network is separated into two components, consisting of a protocol , which manages data, and a transport , which manages application messages.
This can be provided by one piece of software or by many.

In order for client workstations to communicate on a network, they must use a protocol that is identical to what is being used on the network.

Sometimes client workstations are configured to use multiple protocols.
In this case, workstations can communicate with different networks simultaneously.

For example, a client workstation using both IPX and TCP/IP protocols can communicate with servers configured for IPX or TCP/IP protocols only.

The NetWare client protocols support Level 3 (the network layer) through Level 4 (the transport layer) of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) networking reference model from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

The NetWare client software provides the following standard protocols:

- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- BOOTP (provides TCP/IP configuration information)
- ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
- IP (Internet Protocol)
- IPX/SPX TM (Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange TM)
- MIB (Management Information Base)
- NetBIOS (NetBIOS Service Interface)
- RARP (Reverse Address Resolution Protocol)
- RPL (Remote Program Load)
- SNA (System Network Architecture)
- SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- XNS (Xerox Network System)

For information on optimizing your client workstations for using NetWare transport protocols, see Chapter 2, "NET.CFG Options Reference," in NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference .

IPXODI Protocol

Although the NetWare DOS Requester intercepts and prepares requests for network transmission, the actual delivery is made by the IPX protocol.
The NetWare client software supports this through the Internetwork Exchange Open Data-Link Interface (IPXODI.COM program).

IPXODI attaches a header to each data packet.
The header specifies necessary information for targeted network delivery, announcing where the packet came from, where it's going, and what happens after its delivery.

The targeting ability of IPXODI is important but, by itself, does not guarantee successful delivery of a data transmission. 

IPXODI transmits data packets as datagrams (self-contained packages that move independently from source to destination) and, therefore, can deliver the packets only on a best-effort basis.
Delivery is guaranteed only when using the SPX protocol.

SPX Protocol

SPX (Sequenced Packet Exchange) is a protocol within IPXODI that is derived from the Novell IPX protocol using the Xerox Sequenced Packet protocol.
It enhances IPX by supervising data sent out across the network.

SPX verifies and acknowledges successful packet delivery to any network destination by requesting a verification that the data was received.

Within this verification must be a value that matches the value calculated from the data before transmission.
So SPX ensures not only that the data packet arrived, but that it arrived intact. 

SPX can track a single data transmission or data transmissions consisting of a series of separate packets.
If an acknowledgment request brings no response within a specified time, SPX retransmits it.

After a reasonable number of retransmissions fail to return a positive acknowledgment, SPX assumes the connection has failed and warns the operator of the failure.

TCP/IP Protocol

The Novell Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) software (the TCP/IP.EXE file) provides communication between NetWare (IPX) networks across an IP internet that does not directly support IPX.
This is known as IPX/IP tunneling.

NetWare TCP/IP also provides a transport interface for higher-level networking services.
This interface provides client workstations data-communication services to the Network File System (NFS), and third-party applications supporting the 4.3 BSD UNIX« socket interface, the AT xxx Streams Transport Layer Interface (TLI), MS Windows Sockets, and NetBIOS interface using the RFC-1001/1002 compliant B-node (broadcast) type of the NetBIOS protocol.

NetWare TCP/IP supports ODI LAN drivers for the following frame types:

- Ethernet DIX
- Ethernet 802.2 and SNAP
- Token-ring 802.2 and SNAP
- ARCnet xxx 
- IBM xxx PCN2
- FDDI
- SLIP and PPP asynchronous serial line

Introduction

Proper preparation is important to the ease and success of your installation or upgrade.
Preparation ensures that your hardware and software are configured properly and that you have the necessary information to successfully complete all of your client workstation installations or upgrades.

The complete hardware and software setup for client workstations might require you to complete one or more of the following tasks: 

- Preparing Client Workstations
- Preparing the NetWare Client Installation Software 
- Creating Client Installation Diskettes from CD-ROM 
- Setting Up for Installation from a Network Directory
- Editing the INSTALL.CFG File 

Preparing Client Workstations

Preparing client workstations for installing or upgrading the NetWare Client software requires hardware and software setup on each client workstation that you want to use on the network.

The complete setup for preparing workstations requires the following:

- Setting Up Workstation Hardware
- Setting Up the Network Board 
- Setting Up Workstation Software 

If you are upgrading from a previous version of the NetWare Client software, your current workstation hardware and software configuration should be sufficient.
See "Preparing the NetWare Client Installation Software" on page 76 to continue preparing for installation.

Otherwise, continue with the next section.

Setting Up Workstation Hardware

The following checklist can help you determine what hardware setup you need for installing the NetWare Client software.

An IBM PC (or compatible) with an XT xxx , AT xxx , 8088, 286, 386, or 486 (SX, SLC, DX, etc.) processor.
A hard drive or a floppy drive and diskette with the following amount of available disk space:

- DOS only: 1.2 MB 
- DOS and MS Windows: 4 MB.
The NetWare Client installation program sends an error message warning you that you have insufficient disk space if the total available disk space is below 5 MB when installing files for both DOS and MS Windows.


A network board installed in your client workstation: Record the board settings to use during installation.
See "Setting Up the Network Board" on page 71 for more information on how to determine and set the board settings.

For information on installing the network board, see the manufacturer's documentation.

Network cabling:Each type of network board requires unique cabling.
See the manufacturer's documentation packaged with your network board for requirements.

Token ring network boards require a cable connection to the MAU before installing the NetWare Client software.
Otherwise, the NTR2000 driver will not load.

(Optional) If you are installing a remote boot client workstation, a Novell « (or compatible) Remote Reset PROM inserted in each network board in all client workstations that will boot remotely.
See Chapter 6, "Setting Up Remote Client Workstations," on page 133 for more information.

Setting Up the Network Board

When you install the network board, it must be configured.

Configuring the network board involves assigning particular values to certain settings on the board.
These settings allow the network board to communicate with the workstation hardware and networking software.

In most cases, you should leave your network board set to the factory default settings.
If you need to change the default settings, see the manufacturer's documentation.

Some network boards require you to configure the board by setting switches on the board manually, before you place it in the bus slot located in the motherboard of your workstation.

Other boards have a software program that allows you to configure the board after you have placed it inside your workstation. 

See the manufacturer's documentation for information about configuring your particular network boards.

You can obtain setting information for your network board by using the following procedures.

If you have EISA or MCA network boards Then Run the workstation's setup or reference program.
This program lists the values for your network board settings. 

ISA network boards. Look at the network board itself to obtain the specific settings.
The documentation provided with your network board will direct you where to find each setting value.

PCI Local Bus network boards. 
Run the workstation's setup or reference program.
This program lists the values for your network board settings. 

If you have a network connection already, type "NVER" in the PUBLIC directory at the command line to view board settings.

It is important that you keep a record of the settings you use to configure the network boards, because the NetWare Client installation program requires specific information about the network board installed in each client workstation.
Before loading the client installation program, record the values for the following settings:

Hardware interrupt.In most cases, you can use IRQ3 or IRQ5 for your network board if these are not already used by COM2 and LPT2.
If neither IRQ3 nor IRQ5 is available, see the manufacturer's documentation.
The following table shows the IRQ settings that are commonly used by other devices, and the settings that might be available. 

If you specify an interrupt for the network board that is already being used by another device, you can still install the network board but the network software will not run successfully. 

Base I/O port.
The base input/output port is a channel used by the network board to transfer information to the CPU.
Each hardware device included in your client workstation must have a different base I/O port setting.
For more information, see the manufacturer's documentation.
The following table shows a list of standard I/O ports and the devices that commonly use them.
If a workstation does not have any one of thesedevices, the I/O port given in the table for that device might be available for other use.

Base Memory Address.The base memory address specifies the location in memory that the network board uses to exchange information across the network.
It is also known as the RAM start address.
Some network boards do not use RAM; if your network board is one of these, you do not need to specify a value for this setting.
The base memory address often available for the network board is D800 (sometimes written as D8000).
If you use a memory manager (for example, EMM386 or QEMM xxx ), you might need to exclude this base memory address if the memory manager cannot detect automatically that the memory address is used by the network board.

Media frame type.All client workstations and servers using a single network address must use the same frame type.
If you have a network connection already, read the frame type parameter for the LINK DRIVER option in your NET.CFG file.
In NetWare 2 and NetWare 3 TM , Novell Ethernet LAN drivers defaulted to the Ethernet 802.3 frame type.
In NetWare 4 TM, the default frame type is 802.2 for Ethernet ODI LAN drivers.
If you use the Ethernet 802.2 frame type on client workstations, the workstations cannot connect to a network expecting the Ethernet 802.3 frame type.
Place the frame types (Ethernet 802.2 and Ethernet 802.3) in the same order on both the server and client workstations to eliminate a potential conflict.
For information on frame types supported by common network board drivers, see "FRAME frame_type" under "Link Driver Option" in Chapter 2 of NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference.

Other settings.There are other parameters unique to the network board installed in your client workstation.
See the documentation provided with your network board for more information.
For information on ODI LAN driver parameters for your network boards, see "Link Driver Option" in Chapter 2 of NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference.

Setting Up Workstation Software

Preparing workstation software requires setup on each client workstation that you want to use on the network.

If you are upgrading your client software from a previous version of the NetWare Client software, your current workstation hardware and software configuration should be sufficient.
In this case, go to "Preparing the NetWare Client Installation Software" on page 76 to continue preparing for installation.

The following checklist can help you determine what preparations you need to make for installing the NetWare Client software. 

- A running copy of Novell DOS TM 7 or later, DR DOS« 5 or later, MS-DOS 3 or later, or PC-DOS 3 or later.
- (Conditional: if using MS Windows) A copy of MS Windows 3.x or Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) 3.11 installed on your client workstation.
- (Optional)
If you have DOS and MS Windows client workstations running an IPX.COM file generated by DOSGEN or SHGEN, upgrade your dedicated IPX driver to ODI.
See "Upgrading Your IPX Driver to ODI" on page 86 for instructions.


Preparing the NetWare Client Installation Software

Preparing the NetWare Client installation software depends greatly on the current state and condition of your client workstations and NetWare Client software packaging.

Complete one or more of the following tasks for preparing the installation software:

If your client software is on CD-ROM, go to one of the following sections:

- To prepare for installing a new client workstation from diskettes, see "Creating Client Installation Diskettes from CD-ROM" on page 76 for more information.

- To prepare for installing existing client workstations from a network directory, see "Setting Up for Installation from a Network Directory" on page 78 for more information.

- If your client software is on diskette, see "Setting Up for Installation from a Network Directory" on page 78 to prepare for installing from a network directory.

- If your workstation is new and does not have any NetWare Client software installed, See Chapter 5, "Installing or Upgrading NetWare Client Software," on page 89 to install to a new workstation. 

- If you need to modify the installation configuration file for your particular network, see "Editing the INSTALL.CFG File" on page 84 for more information.

Introduction

The NetWare Client installation program copies the NetWare DOS Requester TM and other NetWare Client software for DOS and Microsoft (MS) Windows to specified directories on each client workstation.
It also provides procedures for editing configuration files for your operating environment to run on NetWare.

The NetWare DOS Requester and other core components of the NetWare Client software direct network requests from the client workstations to the network.
After you install the NetWare Client software on your workstation, you can connect to a NetWare network and perform basic network tasks.

See Chapter 2, "Understanding the NetWare Client Software," on page 21 to learn more about how the NetWare DOS Requester and other NetWare Client software works.

Installing or upgrading the NetWare Client software requires set up on each client workstation that you want to connect to and use with NetWare networks and servers.

The complete setup for client workstations that you want to upgrade or install as new requires you to complete the following tasks:

- Running the NetWare Client Installation Program 
- (Conditional) Installing for MS Windows for Workgroups
- (Optional) Setting Up an MS Windows Shared Network Directory for NETX and VLM Client Workstations 

Running the NetWare Client Installation Program

DOS and MS Windows client workstations share the same installation program.
To provide for this, the installation program runs within the DOS environment.

Prerequisites

Review the following checklist to make sure you are prepared to install NetWare Client software.

Close MS Windows before loading the installation program. 
The client installation program modifies some MS Windows files that are used when in MS Windows.
Do not install from an MS Windows DOS Box.

If you are installing from a network directory, make sure you have a drive mapped to SYS:PUBLIC.
See "Mapping a Network Drive for Installation" on page 83 for details.

If you are installing from diskettes, make sure you have working copies of the NetWare Client install disks.

(Conditional) If you want the installation program to display in a language other than English (the default), set a DOS environment variable for NWLANGUAGE=preferred_language.
Replace preferred_language with one of the following languages: 

- DEUTSCH
- ESPANOL
- FRANCAIS
- ITALIANO

For example, to specify Spanish as your preferred language, you would set NWLANGUAGE=ESPANOL .

Loading the Installation Program

For brief instructions, see the Quick Reference Cards for DOS and MS Windows and the screen instructions to complete the installation.

For more detailed information, continue with this section, which explains the following installation tasks:

- Selecting a Destination Directory for the NetWare Client Files 
- Updating System Files on Your Workstation 
- Installing Support for MS Windows 
- Configuring the Target Service Agent (TSA) Software for a Storage Management Services (SMS) Program 
- Installing LAN Drivers 
- Copying Files 

Take advantage of the useful hints about the installation program that are provided at the bottom of the screen.

Procedure

Follow the appropriate set of steps to load the installation program:

For example, type CD CLIENT\DOSWIN .

2. Type INSTALL .

3. Follow the instructions on your screen.

The following figure shows an example of the opening screen in the installation program.

Figure

Installation Program Opening Screen

Selecting a Destination Directory for the NetWare Client Files

The installation program searches for the path to any existing copy of the VLM.EXE file.
If the VLM.EXE file does not exist, the installation program automatically assigns the default path C:\NWCLIENT.

If another version of the NetWare Client software is running in a different directory, replace the default with the path to that directory (see the following procedure).
Otherwise,accept the default path.

The client software included with this installation program is universal to all versions of NetWare.
You will not damage any previous installation of the NetWare Client software by installing this software to the default directory, even if the software already exists in another directory.

Procedure

To change the directory path of the new NetWare Client software, follow these steps:

Select the directory path field in Step 1 on the installation program opening screen and press xxx .

A blinking cursor appears at the end of the path statement in the field.

Edit the field for your specific target directory and press xxx .

The installation program automatically jumps to Step 2 on the screen (which is explained in the procedure on page 94) xxx .

Updating System Files on Your Workstation

To allow for changes to be made to your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files, follow these steps:

Select the "Allow Changes? (Y/N)" field in Step 2 on the installation program opening screen and press xxx . 

A blinking cursor appears at the end of the path statement in the field.

To continue type "Y" or "N" and then press xxx .

The installation program automatically jumps to Step 3 on the screen (which is explained on pages 96 and 97).

If you allow for changes, the original system files are saved as AUTOEXEC.BNW and CONFIG.BNW.

If you do not allow for automatic changes to these files during installation, a copy of the necessary changes is saved to the destination directory (NetWare Client directory).
The files are named CONFIG.NEW and AUTOEXEC.NEW.

You will be required to make these changes manually after the installation.
( See "Creating or Modifying Configuration Files" on page 121 for more information.)

If previous versions of CONFIG.NEW and AUTOEXEC.NEW exist, the installation program overwrites them with the newer information.
You are prompted before any system files set as read-only are copied over.
If you choose not to write over the read-only files, the installation program tries to save the files as CONFIG.NEW and AUTOEXEC.NEW files.
If these .NEW files already exist and are set as read-only, then the installation program does not save changes to any file.

Changes Made to Your AUTOEXEC.BAT File

Your path statement is modified to add the NetWare Client directory and a line is added to call the start-network batch file from the same directory.

For example, if your NetWare Client directory is NWCLIENT, the modification appears as follows: @CALL C:\NWCLIENT\STARTNET.BAT PATH=C:\NWCLIENT;%PATH% 

Changes Made to Your CONFIG.SYS File

Two line are added to your client workstation's CONFIG.SYS file to set the LASTDRIVE and FILES setting.
The modification appears as follows: FILES = 40 LASTDRIVE = Z 

The FILES command is added only if the FILES setting is lower that 40 or does not previously exist.

Installing Support for MS Windows

The installation program copies the necessary files for running Microsoft (MS) Windows on your client workstation.
The default path is set to C:\WINDOWS unless the WIN.COM file is found in the DOS PATH.
If the WIN.COM file is not found in the PATH, then the default setting is no MS Windows support.

Accept the default path unless you are running one of the following:

- MS Windows from a different local directory.
See "Modifying MS Windows Configuration Files on a Local Directory" on page 96 for more information.

- MS Windows from a shared network directory. 
This option is available to network supervisors only.
See "Modifying MS Windows Configuration Files on a Network Directory" on page 97 for more information.
See "Setting Up an MS Windows Shared Network Directory for NETX and VLM Client Workstations" on page 113 for more information. 

- MS Windows from a network directory. 
This option is for updating users' personal areas.
See "Modifying MS Windows Configuration Files on a Network Directory" on page 97 for more information.

- MS Windows for Workgroups.
See "Installing for MS Windows for Workgroups" on page 111 for more information.
The NetWare Client software for MS Windows is not compatible with the client software for NetWare provided by Microsoft.
If you install MS Windows after installing the NetWare Client software, make sure to neither copy over any NetWare Client software files nor to install the NetWare networking software provided by MS Windows.


Modifying MS Windows Configuration Files on a Local Directory 

To change the directory path of your MS Windows directory for the new NetWare Client software, follow these steps:

Procedure

Select the "Do you wish to install support for MS Windows? (Y/N)" field in Step 3 on the installation program opening screen and press xxx .

You must type "Y" before pressing xxx .

Select the "Windows Subdirectory" field in Step 3 on the screen and press xxx . 

A blinking cursor appears at the end of the path statement in the field.

Edit the field by entering your specific MS Windows directory name and press xxx .

Figure

"Customize Support for MS Windows" Screen

The installation program jumps to the customize option for MS Windows.
Press if you want to install multiple country codes for determining the date, time, and locale of client workstations other than the locale you currently have loaded.

The installation program queries the system to determine which locale and country is active and copies only the necessary Unicode* tables.

To continue type "Y" or "N" and then press xxx .

If you type "Y," the "Customize Support for MS Windows" screen appears.

Modifying MS Windows Configuration Files on a Network Directory

You must have appropriate rights to the network directory for MS Windows.

To modify MS Windows configuration files on a network directory, follow these steps:

Procedure

Select the "Do you wish to install support for MS Windows? (Y/N)" field in Step 3 on the installation program opening screen and press xxx .

Edit the field by typing "Y" and press xxx .

The installation program jumps to the "Enter MS Windows directory" field.
Skip this option and continue unless you also want to update a personal network copy of MS Windows.

Select the "Highlight here and press to customize" option and press xxx .

Select the "For the Network Administrator only: Do you want to set the shared MS Windows path? (Y/N)" field on the screen and press xxx .

A blinking cursor appears at the end of the path statement in the field.

To continue type "Y" or "N" and then press .

If you type "Y," the "Enter the path to the shared directory:" screen appears.

You must have network supervisor rights and a drive mapped to the location of the shared MS Windows directory to install for a shared copy.

Edit the field by entering the specific network MS Windows directory name and press xxx .

Because of the architectural differences between the current NetWare DOS Requester and the previous NetWare Shell software (NETX), the NETWARE.DRV and NETWARE.HLP files for both client software types are incompatible.
Before installing the NetWare Client software for MS Windows to a shared directory, create a new directory, such as "NETXDRV," in the shared MS Windows System directory.
Then, copy the previous NETWARE.DRV and NETWARE.HLP files that support the NetWare Shell software (NETX)to the NETXDRV subdirectory.
Following installation of the NetWare Client software to a shared MS Windows directory, add or make the following modification to the &lsqb;boot&rsqb; heading in the SYSTEM.INI file for each individual client workstation running the NetWare Shell software (NETX): Replace the line network.drv=netware.drv with network.drv=* shared_MS_Windows_directory \netxdrv\ netware.drv . For example: network.drv=*f:apps\winsys\netxdrv\netware.drv 
Ensure that the necessary changes to the MS Windows .INI files were made 
(See "MS Windows Configuration Files Are Modified" on page 108 for more information).
For details on where the SYSTEM directory and .INI files are located, see "Loading MS Windows onto the Network," in Chapter2 of NetWare 4 Supervising the Network . 

Configuring the Target Service Agent (TSA) Software for a Storage Management Services (SMS) Program

Configuring the TSA software on client workstations allows SMS TM architecture-based utilities (such as the NetWare SBACKUP utility or the NetWare Navigator TM utility) access to workstation resources for centralized control on the network.

Target Service Agent (TSA)

This is a program that processes data moving between a specific target and Storage Management Services TM (SMS) applications, such as SBACKUP or NetWare Navigator.

The SMS application, running on the host, sends Setting Up Remote Client Workstations

Overview

This chapter explains how to set up the network so that client workstations (mostly diskless workstations) can boot from the remote boot disk image files stored on a NetWare« server's hard disk.

Introduction

The NetWare software for remote client workstations includes support for remote booting and the IBM architected Remote Program Load (RPL) frames as defined in the IBM Remote Program Load User's Guide .

Remote booting is based on the concept of storing the image of a bootable floppy disk on a NetWare volume.
Remote boot workstations use this image to boot up and attach to a server.

The RPL technology is based on the same concept of storing an image file of a bootable floppy disk on a NetWare volume.

However, RPL relies on a bootstrap program which is downloaded to each remote workstation for attaching to a server.

- Use more than one disk image file name per node address 

- Support the IBM LAN Support Program software

- Compatibility with ODI TM LAN drivers and DOS 5.0 and later 

- Support booting a remote client workstations across a source routing bridge


These client workstations do not need a floppy or hard drive to function on the network and are, therefore, called diskless workstations .

A diskless workstation relies on a Programmable Read-Only Memory (PROM) chip installed in its network board to communicate with the boot server.

When the workstation is powered on, it uses the boot image stored on a server to load the necessary DOS system and NetWare Client TM software files used for connecting to the network.

The image file can include any files you would normally load from a boot diskette before loading the NetWare DOS Requester TM software (the VLM.EXE file).

NetWare allows you to use a default image file for all diskless workstations on the network, or use customized image files unique to each workstation's particular system and network environment.

Setting up remote booting or RPL on NetWare client workstations requires setup on a NetWare server or RPL server, hardware setup on each remote client workstation, and software setup from a client workstation with a connection to the NetWare server you want the remote workstations to boot from.

The complete setup for a remote boot client workstation requires you to complete the following tasks:

- Making a Boot Image File Diskette 
- Setting Up RPL Support 
- Making a Boot Image File Diskette 
- Creating Remote Boot Disk Image Files 
- Booting Remote Workstations 

Installing a Remote Boot PROM Chip Certified by Novell 

Installing a Remote Boot PROM certified by Novell« requires you to complete the following tasks:

- Insert a Remote Boot PROM in every workstation that you want to boot from the network.

- Determine the type of Remote Boot PROM that you are using. 


Installing a Remote Boot PROM Chip Certified by Novell on Your Network Board

For information on how to complete this procedure, refer to the documentation provided with your Remote Boot PROM Kit certified by Novell.

Determining the Remote Boot PROM Type

There are three kinds of Remote Boot PROMs used with NetWare networks.
The three types are referred to as follows:

- Old (Novell IPX TM Remote Boot PROM).
At initialization, the Novell IPX Remote Boot PROM sends an IPX GET NEAREST SERVER protocol frame onto the wire.
This frame is positive identification that this PROM is a Novell IPX Remote Boot PROM.
This type of Remote Boot PROM supports remote booting and does not require setup for RPL support.
See "Making a Boot Image File Diskette" on page 142 to continue.

- Enhanced (Novell Enhanced Remote Boot PROM).
At initialization, the Novell Enhanced Remote Boot PROM sends an 802.2 FIND protocol frame onto the wire.
This frame is positive identification that this PROM is a Novell Enhance Remote Boot PROM that uses the 802.2 FIND-FOUND protocol to attach to a server and download a bootstrap file.
Do not use the RPLODI.COM file with this type of PROM.
The RBOOT.RPL has the ability to interface with ODI LAN drivers loading from boot image files.
This type of Remote Boot PROM supports RPL and requires setup for RPL support.
See "Setting Up RPL Support" on page 137 to continue.

- IBM RPL PROM (IBM Remote Program Load PROM)
At initialization the IBM RPL PROM sends an 802.2 FIND protocol frame onto the wire.
This frame is positive identification that this PROM uses the 802.2 FIND-FOUND protocol to attach to a server and download a bootstrap file.
Do not use the RPLODI.COM file with this IBM RPL PROM.
The ability to interface with ODI LAN drivers loading from boot image files is provided in the following files: TOKEN.RPL, ETHER.RPL, PCN2L.RPL, F1ETH.RPL, RBOOT.RPL.
This type of Remote Boot PROM supports RPL and requires setup for RPL support.
See "Setting Up RPL Support" on page 137 to continue.


The old type of Remote Boot PROMs support only the raw 802.3 and E-II frame types.
The enhanced type support the 802.2 frame type only.

Therefore, it is important to know what frame types your server supports to determine whether the type of Remote Boot PROM you are using is supported.

If your server supports the Ethernet frame type E-II, you can then use either type of Remote Boot PROM.

Some procedures for setting up remote booting on your client workstation are specific to the type of Remote Boot PROM you are using.
For information on the type of Remote Reset PROM you are using, refer to the manufacturer's documentation.

Setting Up RPL Support

Setting up RPL support on the network is necessary only for remote workstations using the Novell Enhanced or IBM RPL PROMs.
Remote workstations using the "old" or Novell IPX Remote Boot PROM do not need to set up RPL support.
See "Making a Boot Image File Diskette" on page 142 for more information.

Setting up RPL support requires you to do the following: 

- Load the RPL.NLM program on the NetWare Server and bind it to the server's LAN driver.

- Load the RPL.COM file on a local client workstation, if you need to boot from a NetWare server across a source routing bridge.

- Ensure that the required files are copied to the appropriate directories.

- Copy newer RPL files to the appropriate directories if existing files are not current.
All of the files necessary for setting up a NetWare remote boot client workstation are located in the RPL directory on NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Disk 2.


Loading the RPL.NLM Program

The RPL.NLM file is a NetWare Loadable Module TM (NLM) program that acts as a protocol stack.
It responds to the IBM architected Remote Program Load (RPL) frames as defined in the IBM Remote Program Load User's Guide.

The RPL.NLM program is used in networks that have diskless workstations installed with the RPL BIOS module known as a Remote Boot PROM .
Currently, RPL is supported on the following network boards:

- IBM Ethernet boards (MCA and Model 25SX)
- IBM PC network boards 
- IBM token-ring network boards
- Novell (or compatible) and third-party network boards with an Enhanced Remote Boot PROM installed 

Procedure

At the server console, load the RPL.NLM program by typing LOAD RPL 

Bind the RPL.NLM program to the network board in the server by typing bind rpl to network_board&lsqb;parameter&rsqb; 

For example, to bind RPL to an NE2000 LAN driver with the Ethernet_802.2 frame type, you would type bind rpl to ne2000 frame=ethernet_802.2 

For details on how to use the BIND parameter for RPL at the command line, see "RPL BIND Parameters" under "Command Line Parameters Reference" in Chapter 3 of NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference.

When the RPL.NLM program loads, it searches the SYS:LOGIN directory for a BOOTCONF.SYS file.
If it finds one, the RPL.NLM program reads the BOOTCONF.SYS file into memory in order to make the file information available when a FIND frame is received from a client workstation.
See "Configuring the BOOTCONF.SYS File" on page 154 for more information.

Loading the RPL.COM File

The RPL.COM file is a Terminate-and-Stay-Resident (TSR) program loaded at a client workstation.
It responds to the IBM architected Remote Program Load (RPL) frames as defined in the IBM Remote Program Load User's Guide.

The RPL.COM file allows a client workstation to function as an RPL Server for downloading the bootstrap file to remote workstations.

It is used in networks that have diskless remote workstations that need to attach to a NetWare server across a source routing bridge with the RPL BIOS module known as a Remote Boot PROM .
Currently, RPL is supported on the following network boards:

- IBM Ethernet boards (MCA and Model 25SX)
- IBM PC network boards
- IBM token-ring network boards
- Novell (or compatible) and third-party network boards with an Enhanced Remote Boot PROM installed 

Procedure

Ensure that a Novell Enhanced Remote Boot PROM is installed in the network board at the client workstation you want to set up as an RPL server.

Create a LOGIN directory at the root of the client workstation by typing MD LOGIN 

Expand and copy the RPL.COM file and bootstrap programs to the LOGIN directory.

See "Copying Newer RPL and Boot Files to the Server" on page 142 for more information.

At a client workstation within the same LAN segment as the remote workstations, load the RPL.COM file by typing RPL 

Bind the RPL.COM program to the network board by adding the following line to the NET.CFG file: protocol rpl bind network_board&lsqb;parameter&rsqb; 

For example, to bind RPL to an NE2000 LAN driver with the Ethernet_802.2 frame type, you would type protocol rpl bind ne2000 frame ethernet_802.2 

You must set the PS=servername or GNS optional BIND parameter to direct remote workstations to the NetWare server that contains the boot disk image file for each workstation.

See "Protocol RPL" in Chapter 2 of NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for more information and a list of optional BIND parameters for RPL.

Ensuring That the Required Files Are in the Appropriate Directories

To boot remote workstations from a NetWare server, the following files must exist on a NetWare server.
These files are automatically copied to the appropriate directories when you install the NetWare server software.

If any of these files do not exist in the LOGIN directory or you assume that the existing files are out of date, see "Copying Newer RPL and Boot Files to the Server" on page 142 for more information.

Remote Boot Support Programs

If any of your remote booting client workstations are using the older type of Remote Boot PROM, the following RPL support programs should be copied to the SYS:LOGIN directory of the NetWare server (See "Determining the Remote Boot PROM Type" on page 135 for more information):

Table

Program.
Description.


RPLFIX.COM Allows computers to Remote Program Load correctly with DOS 5 and later. 
The current version of the DOSGEN utility also provides the same functionality as the RPLFIX utility.

RPLODI.COM The DOS TSR acts as an interface between the older type of Remote Boot PROM and Novell ODI LAN drivers.
Use this file only if the following conditions exist:

- You are loading the LSL TM , ODI LAN driver, IPXODI, and NETX or VLM TM software from the boot image file.

- You are using the older type of Remote Boot PROM.


It is not necessary for these programs to reside in the SYS:LOGIN directory.
However, it recommended for ease of use and access during setup.

Certain IBM Micro Channel* workstations, such as the new 386SLC, have a BIOS image file associated with them.
These files are provided by the manufacturer and have a file extension of .IML.
You must create a directory called SYS:\LOGIN\IBMLAN\DCDB\IMAGES on the server and copy all of the.IML files to this directory.

Bootstrap Programs

If any of your remote booting client workstations are using the Enhanced or IBM RPL type of Remote Boot PROM, the following bootstrap programs should reside in the SYS:LOGIN directory of the NetWare server:

Table

IBM Model 25SX Ethernet.


PCN2L.RPL.
IBM PC Baseband Network.


RBOOT.RPL.
Adapters using Novell Boot ROM Kit.


TOKEN.RPL.
IBM Token-Ring Network.


The appropriate bootstrap program (.RPL) is downloaded to the workstation in response to a SEND.FILE.REQUEST call from the Remote Boot PROM.

Together, these files offer the following features and fixes:

- The ability to use BOOTCONF.SYS wildcard characters (* and ?) in specifying node addresses Also, more than one disk image filename is allowed per node address.
BOOTCONF.SYS is parsed by RPL.NLM at the NetWare server to minimize the amount of network traffic.
See "Configuring the BOOTCONF.SYS File"on page 154 for details on how to configure for bootstrap.

- The ability to boot across a source routing bridge 

Copying Newer RPL and Boot Files to the Server

A current version of the RPL and Boot files are stored in the RPL directory on NetWare Client for DOS and Windows Disk 2.

Copy these files to the LOGIN directory on a server by completing the following steps.

Procedure

Expand and copy the contents of the RPL directory from NetWare Client for DOS and Windows Disk2 to the LOGIN directory on a NetWare or RPL server.

To expand a set of files, type NWUNPACKsource_drive :\path\ *.* destination_drive:\path 

For example, to expand and copy the files within the RPL directory on NetWare Client for DOS and Windows Disk 2 to the SYS:LOGIN or LOGIN directory, you could type the following for a NetWare server: NWUNPACK A:RPL\*.* F:\LOGIN or type the following for an RPL server: WUNPACK A:RPL\*.* C:\LOGIN

Understanding Logging In to NetWare Directory Services .


Introduction

Proper client workstation setup can make logging in to the network virtually transparent.
This chapter assumes that the following tasks are completed:

- A User object or user account is created for each user 

- NetWare Client TM software is installed

- A home directory is created for each user
Users with NetWare 2 or 3 client workstation connections to a Netware 4 network must have a User object created in the container where the bindery-based server's context is set.
(Bindery services is set by default for every NetWare 4 server that is installed.)NetWare 2 or 3 users do not need to know their context because they log in to the server rather than to the Directory tree.


Modifying the NET.CFG File for Logging In to NetWare 2 and NetWare 3

When logging in to a NetWare 2 or NetWare 3 TM network, you attach to an individual server.
Then you make additional attachments to other servers that you have a user account on.

Using the Preferred Server Parameter

Use the Preferred Server parameter in the NET.CFG file to direct the client software to the server where your user information is located.

For networks with multiple servers, this parameter is very useful for speeding up logging in to the network.
This parameter also allows you to log in with only your username.

The parameter is as follows: preferred server = server_name 

Do not use both the Preferred Server and Preferred Tree parameters simultaneously.
The second parameter will override the first.

Adding the Preferred Server Parameter to the NET.CFG File 

Open your NET.CFG file in a text editor.

Your client's NET.CFG file was copied to the target directory for DOS files specified during software installation.

Under the NetWare DOS Requester TM heading, type preferred server=server_name 

For example, type preferred server=mktsales . 

Example of the NetWare DOS Requester Section

NetWare DOS Requester Preferred Server=mktsales First Network Drive=f 

Modifying the NET.CFG File for Logging In to NetWare 4 

When logging in to NetWare 4 TM , you don't attach to individual servers as with previous versions of NetWare, but you log in to the entire network.

With your Distinguished Name (DN), you can simplify the login process by adding information to your client workstation's NET.CFG file.
To do this, you need to add lines under the NetWare DOS Requester heading in the NET.CFG file.

If you add lines for the following parameters, you will not need to type your Distinguished Name each time you log in to the network after booting your client workstation:

- Name Context
- Preferred Tree

You must know your name context before making these modifications, or you cannot add entries for the parameters.
For information about setting your client workstation's name context, see "Understanding Logging In to NetWare Directory Services" on page 165.

Using the Name Context Parameter

By using the name context parameter in the NET.CFG file, you inform the NetWare DOS Requester of your name context within the Directory tree.
The LOGIN utility can then locate your User object and connect you to the network.

The parameter is as follows: name context="name_context" 

The default for this parameter is at the root, which might cause confusion if duplicate usernames exist within a Directory tree.

If you are using an earlier version of the NetWare shell on your client workstation, the Name Context parameter is invalid.
NetWare 4 creates a User object for client workstations using NetWare shell files in the same container as the NetWare Server object that you will log in to.
Bindery services is set by default for every NetWare Server object that is installed.

Therefore, users log in directly to a server rather than to the Directory tree.

Using the Preferred Tree Parameter

By using the Preferred Tree parameter in the NET.CFG file, you direct the NetWare DOS Requester to the Directory tree where your name context is set.
The LOGIN utility can then save time by searching only the preferred Directory tree.

Add this parameter to your NET.CFG file if you are using NetWare 4 on a network with multiple Directory trees.

The parameter is as follows: preferred tree=tree_name 

The default for this parameter is at the root.
Because of this, it is important that this parameter is used to avoid confusion if duplicate usernames exist within separate Directory trees.

Do not use both the Preferred Server and Preferred Tree parameters simultaneously.
The second parameter will override the first.

Modifying the NetWare DOS Requester Option

The Netware DOS Requester option allows you to configure the way your client workstation software interacts with the network. 

To modify this option's section in your NET.CFG file, complete these steps.

Procedure

Open your NET.CFG file with a text editor.

The NET.CFG file is located in your client workstation directory.
This is the destination directory specified during client software installation.

Under the NetWare DOS Requester heading, type name context="complete_name" 

For example, type name context="esayers.sales.novell us" 

(Conditional) If your network has multiple Directory trees, type preferred tree=preferred_tree_name 

For example, type preferred tree=novell us .

Example of the NetWare DOS Requester Section

NetWare DOS Requester name context "Esayers.sales.novell us" preferred tree=novell us first network drive=f 

Understanding Logging In to NetWare Directory Services 

NetWare Directory Services TM architecture makes logging in to the network convenient.

User information resides in a global database.
Each user is assigned a position, or context , within the global database that informs the network where the user's User object is located in relationship to the entire network.

In the NET.CFG file, the context of your User object is referred to as your name context .

Your User object is given a name called its common name .
When you log in to the network, the LOGIN utility must know where your particular User object is located---its context.

Your User object's context also forms its Distinguished Name .
The path from the object to the root of the tree constitutes the object's Distinguished Name, which is unique---different from all other objects' Distinguished Name.

Your User object's Distinguished Name is a bottom-up traversal of the tree, from the object up to the root.

Using the Correct Format of Your Distinguished Name for Logging In to the Network

When you use a Distinguished Name of a User object, its common name is listed first, followed by a period (.); then the name of the Organizational Unit (a container object), also followed by a period; and on up through the Organization object name (and the Country object name, if used).

So your User object's Distinguished Name could be represented by

- Common name 
- Organizational Unit name. 
- Organization object name
- Country object name

The actual structure of your Distinguished Name depends on the way your network is defined.

Specifying the Name Type of an Object

A name type distinguishes the class of object that you are referring to, such as a User object or an Organizational Unit object.

For example, you could express SAYERS.SALES.NOVELL US as CN=ESAYERS.OU=SALES.O=NOVELL US where CN is the common name of the User object, OU is the Organizational Unit name, and O is the Organization name.

When you move from one container object to another, you must always include the name type of an object when typing out its Distinguished Name or context.

You also must always include the name types of the objects in Distinguished Names or contexts when you include the Country object in your Directory tree.
Therefore, even when you refer to objects located in the same container object, you must designate their name types (CN, OU, or O).

Changing Your Context

When you move from one container object to another, you change contexts .
Whenever you change contexts, you might need to indicate the Distinguished Name of the object you are changing context to.

For example, in the following figure, if the User object named Brent located in Test.MedTec wants information from the Server object called SERVER1 that is located in the context Development.MedTec, then Brent must refer to the context of the Server object when changing context to access SERVER1.

Once you are logged in, use the following utilities to change the context of your User object within the Directory tree: 

- The CX utility at the DOS command line 
- The "Change Context" option in the NETUSER utility for DOS 
- The "Drive Connections" window in NetWare User Tools for MS Windows 

Logging In to Your Context

Type LOGINcontext 

Replace context with your Distinguished Name.
For example, type LOGIN ESAYERS.SALES.NOVELL US 

Enter your user password (if required).

Logging Out of a NetWare Server or Network.


Introduction

Logging in to a NetWare server or network is the procedure that provides your client workstation access to network resources such as network directories, printers, and applications.

When you initiate a login request, the NetWare operating system looks for your specific security rights and then prompts you to enter a password.

All security information is placed into the NetWare server's connection list and your client workstation is logged in.

At this point, the LOGIN utility executes one or more login scripts (which initialize environment variables, maps network drives, etc.).

With the necessary modifications made to your NET.CFG file, you need only your username and password to log in to a preferred server for NetWare 2 and NetWare 3 TM networks, or a preferred tree and name context for NetWare 4 TM networks.

Prerequisites

Ensure the following before logging in: The NetWare Client TM software is loaded.

If your client workstation can use an Open Data-Link Interface TM (ODI) network board driver, load the following software: LSL.COM Network board driver (for example, NE2000.COM) IPXODI.COM VLM.EXE

If your client uses only a dedicated IPX TM driver (not an ODI TM driver), load the following programs: IPX.COM VLM.EXE.

(Conditional: if using MS Windows) The NetWare Client software has been loaded before MS Windows was loaded.

(Recommended) The NET.CFG file is modified for login.

If you do not modify the NET.CFG file, the Distinguished Name (complete name) for each login is required.
See Chapter 7,"Setting Up NetWare Client Workstations to Log In," on page 161 for information.

Logging In from the DOS Prompt

The login program connects your client workstation to a server or the network.
The NetWare Client software automatically maps the first network drive of your client workstation.

See the following sections for specific login procedures: 

- Logging In to a NetWare 2 or NetWare 3 Network (page 171) 
- Logging In to a NetWare 4 Network (page 172) 
- Logging In to NetWare 4 with a NetWare Bindery Connection (page 172)

Logging In to a NetWare 2 or NetWare 3 Network

Change to the first network drive by typing F: 

The NetWare DOS Requester TM software automatically maps the first network drive for your client workstation.

The default drive is F:.
To change the default, edit the FIRST NETWORK DRIVE parameter in your NET.CFG file.

See Chapter 2, "NetWare DOS Requester Option," in NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for procedures.

Log in to the network in one of the following ways:

If a default (preferred) server is set in your NET.CFG file, you can log in using only your username by typing LOGIN username 

For example, type LOGIN ESAYERS 

See Chapter 7, "Setting Up NetWare Client Workstations to Log In," on page 161 for more details.

If a default (preferred) server is not set in your NET.CFG file, or if you want to log in to a server other than the default, type LOGINservername\username 

For example, type LOGIN TSMKT\ESAYERS 

Enter your password (if required).

Logging In to a NetWare 4 Network

Change to the first network drive by typing F:> 

The NetWare DOS Requester software automatically maps the first network drive for your client workstation.

The default drive is F:.
To change the default, edit the FIRST NETWORK DRIVE parameter in your NET.CFG file.

See Chapter 2, "NetWare DOS Requester Option," in NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for procedures.

Log in to the network in one of the following ways:

If your name context is set in your NET.CFG file, log in to the Directory tree using only your username by typing LOGIN username 

For example, type LOGIN ESAYERS 

See Chapter 7, "Setting Up NetWare Client Workstations to Log In," on page 161 for more details.

To log in to a specific server, type LOGINservername\username 

For example, type LOGIN TSMKT\ESAYERS 

Enter your password (if required).

Logging In to NetWare 4 with a NetWare Bindery Connection 

Type LOGINserver/username/B 

Replace server with the name of the bindery server.
Replace username with your username. 

For example: LOGIN TSMKT/ESAYERS /B 

Enter your password (if required).

Logging In from MS Windows

You can use the NetWare User Tools in MS Windows to log in to NetWare 2, NetWare 3, and NetWare 4 by completing these steps.

The "Login" option under NetWare User Tools for MS Windows authenticates you to NetWare Directory Services TM in NetWare 4 or to a NetWare server in NetWare 2 and NetWare 3 networks.

It does not run a login script for your client workstation.
If you want to run a login script, your initial login should be done at the DOS command line with the LOGIN utility before loading MS Windows.

Procedure

Load the NetWare User Tools (NWUSER.EXE) by choosing the "NetWare User Tools" icon from the NetWare group.

The "NetWare User Tools" interface screen appears.

From the menu bar, choose the "NetWare Connections" icon.

The "NetWare Connections" window displays available resources. 

From the "Resources" list, choose the resource that you want to log in to.

Choose "Login."

You might be prompted to enter a password before login is completed.
Choose the "Guest" radial button if you do not have an account established on the server or network that you want to connect to.

If you prefer logging in directly from MS Windows, you can simulate some login script functionality by using the "Permanent" option in the "NetWare Drive Connections" window to set up your client workstation drive mappings.

Logging Out of a NetWare Server or Network

Logging out of a NetWare server or network is the procedure that breaks the network connections and deletes drive mappings and printer port captures that were made to the network.

If you log out without specifying a NetWare server name in the LOGOUT command, the client workstation's resource connections to all servers or to the network are terminated.

Therefore, to log out from one server and remain attached to the other servers, specify the server name in the LOGOUT command. 

Also, make sure at least one of the remaining drives is mapped to the PUBLIC directory of a NetWare server that you are still attached to.
Otherwise, you can't access NetWare utilities.

Logging Out from DOS

Log out in one of the following ways:

- If you want to log out from the network or all connected servers, type LOGOUT 

- If you want to log out from a specific server, type LOGOUT servername 
Replace servername with the name of the server you want to disconnect from.
For example: LOGOUT TSMKT 


Logging Out from MS Windows

You can use the NetWare User Tools in MS Windows to log out from NetWare 2, 3, and 4 servers or networks by completing these steps.

Procedure

Load the NetWare User Tools by choosing the "NetWare User Tools" icon from the NetWare group.

The "NetWare User Tools" interface screen appears.

From the menu bar, choose the "NetWare Connections" icon.

The "NetWare Connections" window displays available resources. 

Choose the resource that you want to log out from.

Choose "Logout."

Where to Go from Here

After logging in, you can begin setting up your client workstation for additional networking support

The NetWare User Tools for MS Windows (the NWUSER.EXE Program)

Using Universal Naming Convention (UNC) Paths in MS Windows 

Introduction

NetWare allows you to set up and manage network drives on each client workstation.
This gives client workstations the ability to store and access files and applications in a central file system.

This ability is provided through drive mappings which specify particular locations within volumes and directories on the network. 

These drive mappings permit easier navigation of the directory structure and access to hard disks on NetWare servers and other storage media, such as, CD-ROM devices and tape drives.

There are three types of drive mappings in a NetWare environment: 

- Local drives
Point to disk drives installed in a client workstation.
DOS reserves the first five letters (A-E) as local drive mappings. 

- Network drives. 
Point to specific volumes or directories on a network.
The number of network drives you have available depends on the setting for the DOS LASTDRIVE parameter in the CONFIG.SYS file.
In previous versions of the NetWare Client TM software, the first network drive was always the first drive letter not reserved for local use.
This setting was made with the DOS LASTDRIVE parameter in the CONFIG.SYS file.


Because the NetWare DOS Requester TM software is a redirector on the back end of DOS, it requires that the LASTDRIVE=Z parameter be added to the CONFIG.SYS file.
The first network drive is now set in the NET.CFG file.

See "FIRST NETWORK DRIVE" under "NetWare DOS Requester Option" in Chapter 2 of NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for more information.

The NetWare DOS Requester uses the first available DOS drive after the FIRST NETWORK DRIVE parameter set in the NET.CFG.
Consequently, client workstations which accessed, for example, a LASTDRIVE = G parameter setting in their CONFIG.SYS are used to seeing drive H: as the first network drive and not the first drive letter after the last local drive letter.

To maintain compatibility with existing batch files, you might want to add, for example, the FIRST NETWORK DRIVE = H parameter setting under the NetWare DOS Requester heading in the NET.CFG file.
Otherwise, batch files assuming drive H: as the first drive must be altered.

- Search drives. 
Point to specific volumes or directories on a network and add the network volumes or directories to the DOS path.


Using NetWare Utilities to Set Up and Manage Drive Mappings 

NetWare provides you with the following three utilities to set up and manage network drives and search drives for each client workstation in your network:

- The MAP Utility A DOS text utility available in all version of NetWare. 

- The NetWare User Tools for DOS (the NETUSER Utility) A DOS menu utility available only in NetWare 4 software. 

- The NetWare User Tools for MS Windows (the NWUSER.EXE Program) An MS Windows graphical utility available in the NetWare Client Kits for DOS and MS Windows, and in NetWare 3.12 and NetWare 4 TM software.


For online help and information on available options, use the xxx or xxx parameter with text utilities and the F1 key with menu and graphical utilities.

Prerequisites

Before you can use any of the drive mapping utilities, your client workstation requires the following:

- A physical connection to the network 
- Novell DOS TM, DR DOS«, PC-DOS, or MS-DOS loaded and running 
- (Conditional: if using MS Windows) A copy of MS Windows 3.x or Windows for Workgroups 3.11 installed and running 
- The NetWare Client files loaded and running 
See Chapter 5, "Installing or Upgrading NetWare Client Software," on page 89 for more information.

- A connection to the network
See Chapter 8, "Logging In from a NetWare Client Workstation," on page 169 for more information.


The MAP Utility

MAP allows you to assign drives to network directories.
Use MAP to

- Viewdrive mappings 
- Create or change network or search drive mappings 
- Assign a drive to a fake root directory (for applications that must use a root directory) 

MAP is a NetWare workstation utility located in the SYS:PUBLIC directory.
A default drive mapping should exist for the SYS:PUBLIC directory (the default is drive Z:).

To use the MAP utility, you would specify the type of drive mapping and assignment you want by using the following syntax: MAP &lsqb;option...&rsqb;drive:= &lsqb;volume:&verbar; path&rsqb; 

For example, if your username is MARIA and you want to map drive F: to your home directory on file server SALES, you would type MAP F:= SALES\SYS:HOME\MARIA 

See the following references for more information about the MAP utility:

Assigning Drive Mappings in a Specific Order

In many cases, you might find it useful to map network drives in the following order:

- Map the first network drive to the user's home directory. 

- If users are running MS Windows from the network, map a drive to each user's directory that contains user-specific files. 

- Map remaining drives to any directories that users work in frequently, such as project directories or network applications. 


Assigning Drive Mappings for Diverse Environments

Instead of specifying drive letters such as H or G, it can be useful to use an asterisk followed by a number to represent the network drive.

For example, if your first network drive is F: and you use xxx , then that drive is assigned as H: (because xxx , etc.).
Or, if your first network drive is D: and you use "MAP *4:=" ,that drive is assigned as G:.

This allows drive letters to reorder themselves automatically when local drives are removed or added or when the first network drive is changed.

This also allows users to log in from workstations with a different number of local drives than their regular workstations. 

You can map a local drive (usually A: through C:) to a network directory, but you cannot access the local drive until you remove the network drive mapping.

You cannot map a redirected drive, such as a CD-ROM drive, to a network drive.

Assigning Search Drives

You can add network volumes or directories to the DOS path by using the SEARCH drive option in the MAP utility.
This is useful for network applications and files that you want access to regardless of the current directory you are working in.

There is a maximum of 16 NetWare search drives allowed.

When you map a search drive, you use a search drive number (an S followed by a number).
This search drive number assigns the next available drive letter to the mapping, starting with Z and working backwards through the English alphabet.

The letter is put into the DOS path statement.
If you already have drives in the path statement, MAP S1 will overwrite the first one in the path.

To prevent search drive assignments from overriding existing DOS PATH letters, use the INSERT option when assigning search drives.
For example, type MAP INS S16:= path .

To ensure that you can access NetWare utilities, DOS directories, and applications, you should map search drives to the following directories in the order given : 

- Map the first search drive (S1:) to the SYS:PUBLIC directory, which contains the NetWare utilities for DOS and MS Windows client workstations.

- Map the second search drive (S2:) to the DOS directory if you access DOS from the network.

- Map the third and subsequent search drives (S3:, S4:, etc.) to directories containing network applications, project files and frequently used data directories.

- If you are running MS Windows from the network, map a search drive to the MS Windows directory for the MS Windows group.


To avoid inadvertently changing the order of any search drives that must be mapped to a specific drive letter, you can map all remaining search drives with the number S16: or use INS to insert a drive mapping.

If you have an application that requires a particular drive letter, you can use the following command to map the search drive: MAP S16:=drive:=path 

If you map a search drive using a number already assigned to a search drive, NetWare makes the old search drive a network drive.

Assigning Drives to Directory Map Objects (NetWare 4 only) 

Another way to map a drive to a directory is to create a Directory Map object that points to the directory.
Then, if you move the directory, you need to change only the Directory Map object rather than all assignments to that directory.

For example, to map a search drive to a Directory Map object whose Distinguished Name is APPL.SALES_LA.NOVELL_US , type MAP S2:=.APPL.SALES_LA.NOVELL_US 

In the above example, the Directory Map object's name begins with a period, which indicates that the drive is mapped to the drive root.

If your User object exists in the same context as the Directory Map object, such as the example SALES_LA.NOVELL_US , the MAP command does not have to specify the Distinguished Name for the Directory Map object.

Instead, you would type MAP S2:=APPL 

It is best to use Map objects in your current context.

Don't use Distinguished Names that point to other contexts.
If your map is in another context, you should create an alias that points to the real Directory Map object.
See "Alias object" in Concepts for more information.

See Chapter 3, "Creating Login Scripts," in Supervising the Network for more information about Directory Map objects. 

Using Login Scripts or Profiles to Make Drive Mappings Permanent 

You can use login scripts or profiles to automatically set up drive mappings when you log in to the network.Login scripts and profiles are similar to configurable batch files and are executed by the LOGIN utility.

You can use login scripts and profiles to

- Map drives and search drives to directories

- Display messages

- Set environment variables

- Execute programs or menus


Login scripts and profiles work the same way for both DOS and MS Windows workstations.
However, you must run a login script or profile before loading MS Windows.
You cannot run them from an MS Windows session or DOS box.

See the following references for more information about login scripts and profiles:

Introduction

NetWare uses a print queue, a print server, and often a print driver to allow several network client workstations to print to a network printer.

The print server takes print jobs from the print queue and sends them to the printer.
A print driver is used in cases where the application that the print job is being sent from is not NetWare Aware TM (not developed using NetWare APIs) and, therefore, it requires specific setup so that communication from the application to the printer is in a language that the printer understands.

Printing from DOS and MS Windows client workstations is usually accomplished through applications.
Many applications require you to install print drivers that are specific to that program.

If you are logged in to the network and your application supports direct printing through NetWare, you do not have to perform any setup.

If you want to print from an application which is not NetWare Aware, or print directly from the screen, you must set up and configure your local printer port (LPT1) to send print jobs to a print queue.

Using NetWare Utilities to Set Up Network Printing

NetWare provides you with the following three utilities to set up printing for client workstations in your network:

- The CAPTURE Utility
A DOS text utility available in all version of NetWare. 

- The NetWare User Tools for DOS (the NETUSER Utility)
A DOS menu utility available in NetWare 4 TM only.

- The NetWare User Tools for MS Windows (the NWUSER.EXE Program) An MS Windows graphical utility available in the NetWare Client TM Kits for DOS and MS Windows, and in NetWare 3.12 and NetWare 4 software.


For online help and information on available options, use the xxx or xxx parameter with text utilities and the F1 key with menu and graphical utilities.

Prerequisites

Before you can use any of the print setup utilities, your client workstation requires the following:

- A physical connection to the network 
- Novell« DOS TM , DR DOS«, PC-DOS, or MS-DOS loaded and running 
- (Conditional: if you are using MS Windows) A copy of MS Windows 3.x or MS Windows for Workgroups 3.11 installed and running 
- The NetWare Client TM files loaded and running See Chapter 5, "Installing or Upgrading NetWare Client Software," on page 89 for more information. 

- A connection to the network See Chapter 8, "Logging In from a NetWare Client Workstation," on page 169 for more information.

- Access to network printing resources 

The CAPTURE Utility

Use CAPTURE to

- Set up connection to print queues 
- Control network printing 
- View information about network printing 
- Redirect a printer port to the network 

Using CAPTURE at the Command Line

Use CAPTURE at the command line to set up printing by completing the following procedure.

Procedure

Type the following command at a DOS prompt: CAPTURE &lsqb;option&rsqb; 

See Chapter 3, "Command Line Reference," in NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for a listing of available options and descriptions.

(Conditional) If you are running applications that print to a port, such as LPT1, set up the correct print driver within each application for the printer you are sending jobs to.

See the manufacturer's documentation for information about print drivers.

Once you have captured a port to a network printer or print queue, all printing from the screen or applications to LPT1 will be redirected to the designated server and queue.

You can't use CAPTURE with COM ports (you can use it only with LPT ports).
However, the DOS MODE command allows you to redirect COM ports to LPT ports.
For more information, see your DOS manual or the documentation that came with your printer.

Example

An example of a common command line statement for the CAPTURE utility is as follows: CAPTURE /Q=LASERJET4 /S=SALES /P=P1 /TI=5 

This command indicates the following:

- Capture to print queue LaserJet4
- The server connection is to Sales
- Capture to network printer P1
- Timeout in 5 seconds

Using CAPTURE Login Scripts or Profiles

You can use login scripts or profiles to automatically set up port captures when you log in to the network.
Login scripts and profiles are similar to configurable batch files and are executed by the LOGIN utility.

You can use login scripts and profiles to 

- Capture ports to network printer and queues 
- Display messages 
- Set environment variables 
- Execute programs or menus 

Login scripts and profiles work the same way for both DOS and MS Windows workstations.
However, you must run the login script or profile before loading MS Windows.

You cannot run them from an MS Windows session or DOS box.

With this option marked, MS Windows bypasses the Print Manager and prints directly to the network print queue, giving you optimal printing performance.

Exit the "Network Options" dialog box by choosing "OK".

If you are running applications that print to a port, such as LPT1, see the manufacturer's documentation for information about print drivers.

Using a Local Printer on the Network

To access a parallel or serial printer through the network that is cabled to a workstation running MS Windows 3.0 or 3.1, do only one of the following:

- Configure the printers to use polled mode instead of a specific interrupt number.

- Set the workstation to use a specific interrupt.
Add the following lines to the SYSTEM.INI file under the [386Enh] section:
xxx 


Replace lpt1 with the port that the printer is cabled to (LPT2, COM1, COM2, etc.).

Setting the Number of Available Printer Connections

Open the Netware Client configuration (NET.CFG) file in an ASCII text editor.

Add the following lines to the file: NetWare DOS Requester network printers =number 

Replace number with the number of printer connections.

- Maximum xxx 9
- Default xxx 3

For example, to allow for the maximum number of printer connections, you would type NetWare DOS Requester network printers = 9 

Save the changes and then close the NET.CFG file.

Open the MS Windows WIN.INI file in an ASCII text editor.

Add as many lines as you need under the xxx section.

For example: xxx 

Add a filename to a line under the xxx option to have print files print directly to this file.
The filename should have a .PRN file extension followed by an equal sign.

This causes the named file to appear in the Control Panel "Printer Configuration" dialog box.
Any print jobs sent to this file direct their output to it.

Using Universal Naming Convention (UNC) Port Redirection in MS Windows

NetWare supports the use of Universal Naming Convention (UNC) redirection for entries in the xxx section of the WIN.INI file.

UNC port redirection provides you with the ability to use a network print resource without formally capturing a port to it.

Prerequisites

Before setting up UNC redirection for network printers and queues, your client workstation requires the following:

- The NetWare User Tools and NetWare Client files for MS Windows loaded and running See Chapter 5, "Installing or Upgrading NetWare Client Software," on page 89 for more Integration with Other Systems

Introduction

The task-switching support software for NetWare, the TBMI2.COM and TASKID.COM files, acts as a buffer and manager between IPX TM and SPX TM requests and an application's calling process during task switching.

When a task switch is made during an application's call process, the NetWare task-switching support software ensures that IPX and SPX transport protocols send the call to the proper network resource.
This prevents any communication breakdown between IPX and software processes when a task switch is made.

You might need this support if you use a DOS task switcher or if you switch DOS sessions within MS Windows in standard or real mode.
If your application does require the NetWare task-switching support software and you do not use it, your client workstation might hang or experience session failure.

If the only IPX/SPX TM application you are using is NetWare DOS Requester TM, you don't need to load the task-switching files.
If you are not sure whether your application needs task-switching support, go ahead and run the task-switching files; they use only a small amount of memory.
After running the application, enter the /D command line parameter and look at the number in the "Far Call Usage" field.
If this number is zero, your application has not used the task-switching files, so you can run it without them.

You must use the NetWare task-switching support files if your environment has any of the following characteristics: 

- You plan to switch between applications in DOS or DOS sessions in MS Windows

- Your application bypasses the NetWare DOS Requester software and accesses IPX or SPX directly

- You are running MS Windows in standard or real mode


Setting up the task-switching support requires setup on each client workstation that you want to use in task-switching environments.

The complete setup for client workstations using the task-switching support software requires you to complete the following tasks: 

- Installing a Task-Switching Environment
- Installing the Task-Switching Support Software and NetWare Client Files
- Modifying the DOS System and NetWare Client Configuration Files

Installing a Task-Switching Environment

Some well known task-switching environments are Microsoft (MS) Windows, the MS-DOS 5.0 task switcher, DESQview xxx , and the Novell DOS Task Manager.

You need to install and load the task-switching software before setting up and configuring client workstations for a task-switching environment.
See the documentation provided with the software for information on installation and setup.

Installing the Task-Switching Support Software and NetWare Client Files

Copying the Files to the NetWare Client Directory Automatically

The task-switching support software files (TASKID.COM and TBMI2.COM) are automatically copied to the NetWare Client directory when you run the NetWare Client installation software.

See Chapter 5, "Installing or Upgrading NetWare Client Software," on page 89 for more information.

Copying the Files to the NetWare Client Directory Manually 

If you choose to not run the NetWare Client installation software, you must manually copy the task-switching support software files and other client files to the NetWare Client directory. 

To manually copy the TASKID.COM and TBMI2.COM files and other client files from the NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows diskettes, complete the following steps.

Procedure

Expand and copy the following files from the NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows diskettes to the NetWare Client directory (the default is C:\NWCLIENT).

To expand a file, type NWUNPACKsource_drive:path \filenamedestination_drive:path\filename 

For example, to expand the TBMI2.COM file, you could type NWUNPACK A:TBMI2.CO_ C:\NWCLIENT\TBMI2.COM 

Repeat Step 1 until the TASKID.COM, TBMI2.COM, and NetWare Client files exist in the NetWare Client directory.

Modifying the DOS System and NetWare Client Configuration Files

Modifying the DOS system and NetWare Client configuration files requires you to edit the CONFIG.SYS, STARTNET.BAT, and NET.CFG files with ASCII text editor.

Modifying the CONFIG.SYSFile

Modify the CONFIG.SYS file with an ASCII text editor to set the LASTDRIVE variable to Z for the NetWare DOS Requester software.

Procedure

Open the CONFIG.SYS file in an ASCII text editor.

For example, to use the Novell DOS TM 7 System Editor at the command line to edit the CONFIG.SYS file in the root directory, you would type EDIT C:\CONFIG.SYS 

Set the LASTDRIVE variable to Z by adding the following line to the file: LASTDRIVE = Z 

Save your changes and exit the ASCII text editor.

Modifying the STARTNET.BAT File

Modify the STARTNET.BAT file with an ASCII text editor to load the Link Support Layer TM (the LSL.COM file), the ODI TM LAN driver, the task-switching support software (the TBMI2.COM file), and the NetWare DOS Requester software.

Ensure that the TBMI2.COM file is loaded in the STARTNET.BAT file before loading a task-switching environment.
If you are currently loading task-switching software in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, move the line to the STARTNET.BAT file.

Procedure

Add the following lines, in the given order , to the STARTNET.BAT file to load one of the task-switching support software files and the NetWare Client files: xxx 

Replace path with the directory where the TBMI2.COM and NET.CFG files are found.
The TBMI2.COM file cannot execute unless it can access the NET.CFG file in the proper directory path.

Replace odi_lan_driver with the name of the ODI LAN driver that your workstation is using.

To automatically unload the TBMI2.COM file after closing that task-switching environment, use the /U command line parameter after the command that loads a task-switching environment.

For example, to unload the TBMI2.COM file after closing the Novell DOS TASKMGR.EXE file, add the following lines: tbmi2 c:\nwdos\ askmgr tmbi2 /u 

Save your changes and exit the ASCII text editor.

You can also use command line parameters to override NET.CFG parameters at the command line.
See Chapter 3, "Command Line Parameters Reference," in NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for more information.

Modifying the NET.CFG File

The task-switching support software (the TBMI2.COM and TASKID.COM files) allows you to specify variables for the following parameters in your NET.CFG file:

- DATA ECB COUNT
- ECB COUNT
- INT64
- INT7A
- USE MAX PACKETS
- USING WINDOWS 3.0

See "TBMI2 Option" in Chapter 2 of NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for details on how to configure your client workstation for task-switching environments.

If you want to set parameters in a batch file or override NET.CFG settings at the command line, see Chapter 3, "Command Line Parameters," in NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for details on how to use command line parameters for the TBMI2 and TASKID software

To configure the parameters for the task-switching support software, complete the following procedure.

Procedure

Open your NET.CFG file with an ASCII text editor.

For example, to use the Novell DOS 7 System Editor at the command line to edit the NET.CFG file in the NetWare Client directory (the default is C:\NWCLIENT), you would type EDIT C:\NWCLIENT\NET.CFG 

Make the necessary configurations for your particular task-switching software.

See the manufacturer's documentation for information.

Save your changes and exit the NET.CFG file.

You can also use command line parameters to override NET.CFG parameters at the command line.
See Chapter 3, "Command Line Parameters Reference," in NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for more information.

Loading the Task-Switching Support Software

If you are running MS Windows in enhanced mode or not switching between DOS sessions within MS Windows, then do not use the TBMI2 software.

Loading the TBMI2.COM file for task-switching environments requires you to complete the following procedures.

For DOS and MS Windows 3.1 and Later

Ensure that your task-switching environment is setup and running.

See "Installing a Task-Switching Environment" on page 212 for more information.

Ensure that the TBMI2.COM and NetWare Client software files are installed on each client workstation that you want to run in a task-switching environment.

See "Installing the Task-Switching Support Software and NetWare Client Files" on page 213 for more information.

Ensure that all necessary modifications are made to the client workstation configuration files.

See "Modifying the DOS System and NetWare Client Configuration Files" on page 214 for more information.

Reboot each client workstation.

The STARTNET.BAT file loads the TBMI2.COM and NetWare Client software files.

For MS Windows 3.0

Complete the previous procedure, "For DOS and MS Windows 3.1 and Later." 

Run MS Windows.

Open a DOS session.

At the new system prompt, load TASKID by typing TASKID 

For each DOS session you open, repeat Step 4 before running an application from the system prompt within that session.

Unloading the Task-Switching Support Software

Before closing a DOS session with the EXIT command in MS Windows 3.0, unload the TASKID.COM file by typing TASKID /U 

If you do not unload TASKID before you close a DOS session in MS Windows 3.0, your computer might hang.

Unload the TBMI2.COM file by typing TBMI2 /U 

You do not need to unload TBMI2 after you exit MS Windows unless you want to free memory.

Troubles hooting TBMI2

If you have problems while using the TBMI2.COM file, you might need to change configuration parameters in the NET.CFG file.

See "TBMI2 Option" in Chapter 2 of NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for details on how to configure your client workstation for task-switching environments.

View configuration parameters by typing "TBMI2 /D" at the command line.

Check the values associated with the following:

- "Configured Data ECBs," which tells you how many buffers are available
- "Max Buffers Used," which tells you how many buffers are used
If the number of buffers used approaches or equals the number of buffers available, increase the number of buffers available using the ECB Count and Data ECB Count parameters in the NET.CFG file.

- "Unavail Buffer Count," which tells you how many buffers are unavailable
If the count is more than zero, increase the number of buffers available using the ECB Count and Data ECB Count parameters in the NET.CFG file.
The COMCHECK and RCONSOLE utilities use too many buffers that need to be allocated for TBMI2.
To use either of these utilities under MS Windows, do not load the TBMI2.COM file and do not switch out of the DOS session running either the COMCHECK or RCONSOLE utility before exiting either of the utilities.

Setting Up the NetWare ODI Support Interface for NDIS Protocols

Overview

This chapter explains how to set up client workstations to support connections to other networks that use the Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) protocol, and to access network resources as if they were available from just one network. 

The following topics are covered in this chapter.

Introduction

The ODI TM NDIS support module (ODINSUP) is an Open Data-Link Interface TM (ODI) protocol stack that interfaces between NDIS and NetWare« Client TM LAN drivers.

ODINSUP translates NDIS transmissions from NDIS-based applications into a form that complies with the ODI drivers.

ODINSUP also translates transmissions received from the network into a form understood by the NDIS Protocol Manager (PROTMAN). 

NDIS specifies two type of drivers: one for hardware manipulation, and one for protocol handling.
Hardware-related drivers are also called NDIS MAC (Media Access Control)drivers.

Protocol handling drivers are called NDIS PROTMAN drivers.

By separating these functions, NDIS allows you to have multiple protocols with the same physical adapter, or to use only one driver per physical adapter.
The NDIS Protocol Manager regulates transactions between hardware and protocol drivers.

ODINSUP provides an NDIS MAC interface for each physical adapter in the system.
ODINSUP can be bound with a NET.CFG option to a maximum of four adapters and can generate a separate and distinct MAC interface for each one.
This is the equivalent of having the corresponding NDIS-compliant drivers loaded, plus having a full ODI interface.

ODINSUP provides the following benefits:

- No reconfiguration or rebooting necessary to switch between NDIS-based networks and NetWare networks

- Compatibility between applications written to NDIS and ODI (or compliant) drivers 

- ODI protocol stacks and NDIS protocol stacks can share the same adapter when the ODINSUP module is used 


Setting up the ODI support interface for NDIS protocols requires you to complete the following tasks:

- Installing MAC Drivers and an NDIS Protocol Manager on Client Workstations 

- Installing the ODINSUP.COM and NetWare Client Files 

- Binding ODI LAN Drivers to the NDIS Protocol Stack 

- Modifying the DOS System and NetWare Client Configuration Files


Installing MAC Drivers and an NDIS Protocol Manager on Client Workstations

ODINSUP is designed for NetWare users that want to use NDIS-based networks such 3+Share* or LAN Manager* and to also log in to a NetWare network.
See the manufacturers' documentation for instruction on installation and setup of NDIS MAC and PROTMAN drivers.

If you are upgrading client workstations using NDIS MAC drivers, verify first that the client workstations can connect to the NDIS-based network to ensure that the hardware connection is good.
Once you install the NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows files, the NDIS protocol cannot use the network board to make connections until you have completely set up ODINSUP as instructed in this chapter.

Installing the ODINSUP.COM and NetWare Client Files

Copying the Files to the NetWare Client Directory Automatically 

ODINSUP.COM and the other client files are automatically copied to the NetWare Client directory when you run the NetWare Client installation software.

See Chapter 5, "Installing or Upgrading NetWare Client Software," on page 89 for more information.

Copying the Files to the NetWare Client Directory Manually

If you choose to not run the NetWare Client installation software, you must manually copy the ODINSUP.COM and other client files to the NetWare Client directory.

To manually copy the ODINSUP.COM file and other client files from the NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows diskettes, complete the following steps.

Procedure

Expand and copy the following files from the NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows diskettes to the NetWare Client directory (the default is C:\NWCLIENT).

To expand a file, type NWUNPACK source_drive:path\filenamedestination_drive:path\filename .
For example, to expand the ODINSUP.COM file, you could type NWUNPACK A:ODINSUP.CO_ C:\NWCLIENT\ODINSUP.COM .


Repeat Step 1 until the ODINSUP.COM and NetWare Client files exist in the NetWare Client directory.

Binding ODI LAN Drivers to the NDIS Protocol Stack

The NDIS PROTOCOL.INI file is necessary to tell the NDIS protocols which MAC to bind to and use.

Normally all PROTOCOL.INI information for NDIS MAC drivers can be removed if you are using one NDIS MAC driver and protocol stack only.
No ODINSUP-specific information is necessary in the PROTOCOL.INI file.

Binding ODI LAN drivers to the NDIS protocol stack requires you to edit the PROTOCOL.INI file with a text editor to do the following:

- Bind the NDIS protocol stack to the ODI LAN drivers

- Remove the line binding the NDIS protocol stack to the NDIS MAC drivers 


Procedure

Open the PROTOCOL.INI file with an ASCII text editor.

For example, to use the Novell « DOS TM 7 System Editor at the command line to edit the PROTOCOL.INI file in the BOOT directory, type EDIT C:\BOOT\PROTOCOL.INI 

Find all occurrences of the lines that bind the NDIS MAC drivers.

You can search for Bindings =NDIS_MAC_driver 

For example, to search for an NDIS driver for the 3Com* Ether Link II* board, find the following line: Bindings = elkinii.dos 

If you don't know the name of the NDIS driver to search for, see the documentation included with your network board.

Comment out (with a semicolon) all bindings lines found.

For example, your PROTOCOL.INI file for a 3Com EtherLink II LAN driver might look like the following: [ETHERNET] . . ; Bindings = elkinii.dos 

After each disabled binding line, add a line to bind the NDIS protocol to an ODI LAN driver.

Follow the same syntax as the line you disable by a comment, using the ODI LAN driver name instead of the NDIS driver name. 

For example, to add a line for the 3Com EtherLink II ODI LAN driver 3C503.COM, you would type [ETHERNET]. .Bindings = elkinii.dos Bindings = x3c503 

Driver names in PROTOCOL.INI cannot start with a number.

Therefore, place anxbefore 3Com drivers and other drivers that start with a number (for example: Bindings = x3C503 .)

(Conditional) If you have two or more network boards using the same ODI LAN driver, type an instance number to bind the NDIS protocol to a particular occurrence of a board.

By default, the NDIS protocol uses the first network board of that type.

To have NDIS use a board other than the first one found, you can specify an instance number.

Type the instance number at the end of the driver name, with no space between the driver name and the instance number.

For example, if you have two network boards, direct NDIS to use the second board by typing an instance number for the second board at the end of its name, as shown: [ETHERNET]. . ; Bindings = elkinii.dos Bindings = ne20002 

(Conditional) If you have additional ODI drivers, bind the NDIS protocol to them.

To bind the NDIS protocol to more than one ODI LAN driver, type both driver names on the same line, separated by a comma.

For example, to bind to both an NE2000 driver and an NE1000 driver, type Bindings = ne2000,ne1000 

Save and exit the PROTOCOL.INI file.

Modifying the DOS System and NetWare Client Configuration Files

Modifying the DOS system and NetWare Client configuration files requires you to edit the CONFIG.SYS, STARTNET.BAT, and NET.CFG files with an ASCII text editor.

Modifying the CONFIG.SYS File

Modify the CONFIG.SYS file with an ASCII text editor to 

- Set the LASTDRIVE variable to Z for the NetWare DOS Requester TM software

- Load the NDIS Protocol Manager


Procedure

Open the CONFIG.SYS file with an ASCII text editor.

For example, to use the Novell DOS 7 System Editor at the command line to edit the CONFIG.SYS file in the root directory, you would type EDIT C:\CONFIG.SYS 

Set the LASTDRIVE variable to Z by adding the following line to the file: LASTDRIVE = Z 

Load the NDIS Protocol Manager by adding a line similar to the following to the CONFIG.SYS file: device = path protman.dos /i:path 

Replace both path variables with the directory location of the PROTOCOL.INI file.

/I: directs the CONFIG.SYS file to search for the PROTOCOL.INI file in the specified pathname.

The name and path of the NDIS Protocol Manager depends on the NDIS-based operating system you are running.
See the manufacturer's documentation for information.

Remove all references to the NDIS LAN drivers from the CONFIG.SYS file.

For example, if your CONFIG.SYS file had a device= path elnkii.dos statement to load an ELNKII.DOS NDIS driver, you would remove it from the file.

Save your changes and exit the ASCII text editor.

Modifying the STARTNET.BAT File

Modify the STARTNET.BAT file with an ASCII text editor to load the Link Support Layer TM (the LSL.COM file), the ODI LAN driver, the ODINSUP protocol, the protocol stacks, and the NetWare DOS Requester software.

Procedure

Add the following lines, in the given order , to the STARTNET.BAT file to load the ODI components: cdpathlslodi_lan_driverodinsup netbind ipxodi vlm 

Replace path with the directory where the ODINSUP.COM and NET.CFG files are found.
The ODINSUP protocol cannot execute unless it can access the NET.CFG file in the proper directory path.

Replace odi_lan_driver with the name of the ODI LAN driver that your workstation is using.

Save your changes and exit the ASCII text editor.

Modifying the NET.CFG File

Modify the NET.CFG file with an ASCII text editor to 

- Enable the required Ethernet and token ring frame types 

- Bind the ODINSUP protocol to a particular ODI LAN driver 

- Increase the size of the packet that can be transmitted through the Link Support Layer program (if necessary) 


Procedure

Open the NET.CFG file with an ASCII text editor.

For example, to use the Novell DOS 7 System Editor at the command line to edit the NET.CFG file in the NetWare Client directory (the default is C:\NWCLIENT), you would type EDIT C:\NWCLIENT\NET.CFG 

Enable the appropriate frame types for the ODINSUP software. 

The following table lists the supported frame types for the ODINSUP software.

Frame Types Supported by ODINSUP

Table

Enter the following line at the top of the NET.CFG file: link driver odi_lan_driver .


Replace odi_lan_driver with the name of your ODI LAN driver.
For example, for a token ring LAN driver, enter .


link driver ntr2000 .


Under the Link Driver heading, add the lines to enable all frame types supported by the ODI LAN driver.


For example, to enable all frame types for token ring, add the following lines: link driver ntr2000 frame token-ring frame token-ring_snap .


Or, to enable all frame types for an Ethernet, add the following lines: link driver ne2000 frame ethernet_802.2 frame ethernet_802. frame ethernet_ii frame ethernet_snap .


The first frame defined is the only one used for the initial "Get Nearest Server" request.


Therefore, if you have any servers using only one frame type, list that frame type first.
This allows your client workstation to make a default connection to those servers.

Whenever you edit the NET.CFG file, you must indent settings, as well as follow the other format requirements.
See Chapter 2, "NET.CFG Options Reference," in NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for information.

Bind ODINSUP to one or more ODI LAN drivers.

Do this by adding the Protocol ODINSUP option to your NET.CFG file: protocol odinsup bindodi_lan_driver 

Replace odi_lan_driver with the name of your ODI LAN driver. 

ODINSUP can be bound to a maximum of four ODI LAN drivers for each network board in your client workstation.

Introduction

The NetWare DOS Requester TM software uses protocol drivers and network drivers written to the Open Data-Link Interface TM (ODI) specification.
The IBM LAN Support programs, except for PCNet Support, can use protocol drivers written to the NDIS specification.

The IBM LAN Support module (the LANSUP.COM file) acts as an interface between the NetWare Client TM software and the IBM LAN Support programs.
This interface allows IBM LAN Support programs to communicate with NetWare Client through NDIS network drivers. 

LANSUP.COM is necessary only when you want the NDIS driver to control the network board while accessing one of the IBM LAN Support programs, or when you do not have an ODI (or compliant) LAN driver for your network board.

NetWare Client support for NDIS protocols must be set up on each client workstation that you want to access the IBM LAN Support programs from.

The complete setup for client workstations using LANSUP.COM requires you to complete the following tasks:

- Installing an IBM LAN Support Program

- Installing the LANSUP.COM and NetWare Client Files

- Modifying the DOS System and NetWare Client Configuration Files 


Installing an IBM LAN Support Program

LANSUP.COM is an interface for the following IBM LAN Support programs:

- Extended Services
- LAN Server

You need to install and load one of these programs before setting up and configuring client workstations for a NetWare connection.
See the documentation provided with these programs for information on installation and setup.

If you have Extended Services or LAN Services, you might also want to set up the NetBIOS protocol.
After completing the procedures in this chapter, See Chapter 14, "Setting Up NetBIOS Protocol Support," on page 245 .

Installing the LANSUP.COM and NetWare Client Files

Copying the Files to the NetWare Client Directory Automatically 

The LANSUP.COM file is automatically copied to the NetWare Client directory when you run the NetWare Client installation software.

See Chapter 5, "Installing or Upgrading NetWare Client Software," on page 89 for more information.

Once you install the NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows, the Extended Services and LAN Services programs cannot use the network board to make connections until you have completely set up the LANSUP.COM file as instructed in this chapter.

Copying the Files to the NetWare Client Directory Manually 

If you choose to not run the NetWare Client installation software, you must manually copy the LANSUP.COM and other client files to the NetWare Client directory.

To manually copy the LANSUP.COM file and other client files from the NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows diskettes, complete the following steps.

Repeat Step 1 until the LANSUP.COM and NetWare Client files exist in the NetWare Client directory.

Modifying the DOS System and NetWare Client Configuration Files

Modifying the DOS system and NetWare Client configuration files requires you to edit the CONFIG.SYS, STARTNET.BAT, and NET.CFG files with an ASCII text editor.

Modifying the CONFIG.SYS File

Modify the CONFIG.SYS file with an ASCII text editor to set the LASTDRIVE variable to Z for the NetWare DOS Requester software.

Procedure

Open the CONFIG.SYS file with an ASCII text editor.

For example, to use the Novell « DOS TM 7 System Editor at the command line to edit the CONFIG.SYS file in the root directory, you would type EDIT C:\CONFIG.SYS 

Set the LASTDRIVE variable to Z by adding the following line to the file: LASTDRIVE = Z 

Save your changes and exit the ASCII text editor.

Modifying the STARTNET.BAT File

Modify the STARTNET.BAT file with an ASCII text editor to load the Link Support Layer TM (the LSL.COM file), the LANSUP.COM file, the protocol stacks, and the NetWare DOS Requester software. 

Procedure

Add the following lines, in the given order , to the STARTNET.BAT file to load LANSUP.COM and NetWare Client files: cdpathlsl lansup ipxodi vlm 

Replace path with the directory where the LANSUP.COM and NET.CFG files are found.
The LANSUP.COM file cannot execute unless it can access the NET.CFG file in the proper directory path. 

Save your changes and exit the ASCII text editor.

Modifying the NET.CFG File

The IBM LAN support module (the LANSUP.COM file) requires you to make the following modifications to your NET.CFG file: 

Specify the frame type for each client workstation. 
See the following procedure for details on how to configure this parameter for LANSUP.COM.

(Optional) Specify variables for the following parameters:

- ALTERNATE
- LINK STATIONS
- MAX FRAME SIZE
- NODE ADDRESS
- OPEN
- PROTOCOL
- RPL
- SAPS

See Chapter 2, "NET.CFG Options Reference," in NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for details on how to configure these parameters for LANSUP.

Configure the frame type for LANSUP.COM by completing the following procedure.

Procedure

Open your NET.CFG file with an ASCII text editor.

For example, to use the Novell DOS 7 System Editor at the command line to edit the NET.CFG file in the NetWare Client directory (the default is C:\NWCLIENT), you would type EDIT C:\NWCLIENT\NET.CFG .

Enable the appropriate frame types for LAN.COM.

Because the LANSUP.COM driver uses the Token-Ring Topology Support Module (TSM), LANSUP.COM supports only the following boards and frame types:

Frame Types Supported by LANSUP

Table

Enter the following line at the top of the NET.CFG file:.
link driver lansup .


Under the Link Driver heading, add the lines to enable frame types.


For example, to enable a frame type for token ring, add the following lines to the file: link driver lansup frame token-ring .

To enable both frame types for Ethernet, add the following lines: link driver lansup frame ethernet_802.2 frame ethernet_snap .

The first frame defined is the only one used for the initial Get Nearest Server request.

Therefore, if you have any servers using only one frame type, list that frame type first.
This allows your client workstation to make a default connection to those servers.

Whenever you edit the NET.CFG file, you must indent settings, as well as follow the other format requirements.
See Chapter 2, "NET.CFG Options Reference," in NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for information.

Save your changes and exit the NET.CFG file.

Loading the LANSUP.COM File

Loading the LANSUP.COM file for the IBM LAN Support programs requires you to complete the following procedure.

Procedure

Ensure that your IBM LAN Support programs are set up properly. 

See "Installing an IBM LAN Support Program" on page 236 for more information.

Ensure that the LANSUP.COM and NetWare Client software files are installed on each client workstation that you want to connect to both NetWare and IBM LAN Support programs.

Introduction

NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) is the IBM standard protocol for applications developed to run peer-to-peer communications on the IBM PC Network and the IBM Token-Ring Network.
NetBIOS has become widely accepted as a standard for network interfacing.

The NetWare« Client TM for DOS and MS Windows provides a NetBIOS driver that emulates the NetBIOS protocol.
This emulator allows the NetWare IPX TM to interface with the NetBIOS Interrupt 5Ch and an alternate interface, Interrupt 2Ah.

The NetBIOS provided by Novell is an emulator because it does not transmit NetBIOS packets.
Instead, NetBIOS packets are encapsulated in IPX packets, and the IPX packets are transmitted.

The NetBIOS protocol was designed for small-scale networks.

While Novell has added functionality to the original specification, the NetBIOS emulation still works most effectively with small-scale networks.

Therefore, if your network contains several thousand workstations and your LAN segments are interconnected with more than one router, use SPX TM instead of NetBIOS if your applications support SPX. 

NetWare Client support for the NetBIOS emulator must be set up on each client workstation that you want to access NetBIOS applications from.

The complete setup for client workstations using NetBIOS requires you to complete the following tasks:

- Installing a NetBIOS Application
- Installing the NETBIOS.EXE and NetWare Client Files
- Modifying the DOS System and NetWare Client Configuration Files

Installing a NetBIOS Application

NetBIOS is the IBM standard protocol for applications developed to run peer-to-peer communications on the IBM PC Network and the IBM Token-Ring Network.

You need to install and load a NetBIOS application on a server before setting up and configuring client workstations for a NetBIOS connection.

See the documentation provided with the application for information on installation and setup.

Installing the NETBIOS.EXE and NetWare Client Files

Copying the Files to the NetWare Client Directory Automatically 

NETBIOS.EXE and the other client files are automatically copied to the NetWare Client directory when you run the NetWare Client installation software.

See Chapter 5, "Installing or Upgrading NetWare Client Software," on page 89 for more information.

Copying the Files to the NetWare Client Directory Manually 

If you choose to not run the NetWare Client installation software, you must manually copy the NETBIOS.EXE and other client files to the NetWare Client directory.

To manually copy the NETBIOS.EXE file and other client files from the NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows diskettes, complete the following steps.

Introduction

Named Pipes are the basis for communication between the client and advanced client-server applications such as Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Comm Server software.

Client-server computing provides a mode of distributed network computing in which an application is executed cooperatively by two client workstations.

The client component of the application (the front end) executes on one client workstation, while the server component (the back end) runs on a second client workstation.

Client-server computing allows more effective use of computing resources, higher performance, greater flexibility, simpler upgrades, and (for some applications) greater reliability and data integrity. 

For NetWare« client workstations, communication between client-server applications is implemented most frequently using the Named Pipes underprices communication (IPC) protocol.

A Named Pipes client workstation can be configured to operate in default mode or peer mode.

In default mode, Named Pipes client workstations obtain names for Named Pipes servers by querying an IPX TM (or compatible) router table.
In this mode, Named Pipes client workstations request specific server names on an as needed basis.

In peer mode, Named Pipes client workstations maintain their own Named Pipes server table.
When the Named Pipes Extende is loaded in peer mode, a General Service Query is issued and the query responses from Named Pipes servers are compiled into a table at each client workstation.

To configure for peer mode, see "Named Pipes Option" in Chapter 2 of NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for more information.

NetWare Client support for the Named Pipes protocol (the DOSNP.EXE file) must be set up on each client workstation that you want to access Named Pipes client-server applications from.

In most cases, you must also set configuration options for the Link Support Layer TM (LSL) software.

The complete setup for client workstations using the Named Pipes protocol requires you to complete the following tasks: 

- Installing a Named Pipes Server and Client-Server Application
- Installing the Named Pipes Extender and NetWare Client Files
- Modifying the DOS System and NetWare Client Configuration Files

Installing a Named Pipes Server and Client-Server Application 

The NetWare Client TM for OS/2 software allows a Named Pipes server such as an SQL server to function on a Novell« network. 

You need to set up a NetWare OS/2 client workstation and configure it for Named Pipes services before setting up and configuring DOS and MS Windows client workstations for a Named Pipes connection.
See NetWare Client for OS/2 User Guide for information about installation and setup.

You also need to install the client and server portion of the client-server software that you want to run.
See the manufacturer's documentation for information.

Installing the Named Pipes Extender and NetWare Client Files

Copying the Files to the NetWare Client Directory Automatically 

The Named Pipes Extender and other client files are automatically copied to the NetWare Client directory when you run the NetWare Client installation software.

See Chapter 5, "Installing or Upgrading NetWare Client Software," on page 89 for more information.

Copying the Files to the NetWare Client Directory Manually 

If you choose to not run the NetWare Client installation software, you must manually copy the DOSNP.EXE and other client files to the NetWare Client directory.

To manually copy the DOSNP.EXE file and other client files from the NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows diskettes, complete the following steps.

Procedure

Expand and copy the following files from the NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows diskettes to the NetWare Client directory (the default is C:\NWCLIENT).

To expand a file, type NWUNPACKsource_drive:path\filenamedestination_drive:path\filename 

For example, to expand the DOSNP.EXE file, you could type NWUNPACK A:DOSNP.EX_ C:\NWCLIENT\DOSNP.EXE 

(Conditional) If you are running DOSNP.EXE within MS Windows, expand and copy the NETAPI.DL_ file from the WINDOWS directory on the WSDOS2_2diskette for NetWare Client for OS/2 the SYSTEM directory for MS Windows.

Repeat Step 1 until the DOSNP.EXE and NetWare Client files exist in the NetWare Client directory.

Modifying the DOS System and NetWare Client Configuration Files

Modifying the DOS system and NetWare Client configuration files requires you to edit the CONFIG.SYS, STARTNET.BAT, and NET.CFG files with an ASCII text editor.

Modifying the CONFIG.SYS File

Modify the CONFIG.SYS file with an ASCII text editor to set the LASTDRIVE variable to Z for the NetWare DOS Requester TM software.

Procedure

Open the CONFIG.SYS file with an ASCII text editor.

For example, to use the Novell « DOS TM 7 System Editor at the command line to edit the CONFIG.SYS file in the root directory, you would type EDIT C:\CONFIG.SYS 

Set the LASTDRIVE variable to Z by adding the following line to the file: LASTDRIVE = Z 

Save your changes and exit the ASCII text editor.

Modifying the STARTNET.BAT File

Modify the STARTNET.BAT file with an ASCII text editor to load the Link Support Layer (the LSL.COM file), the ODI TM LAN driver, the DOS Named Pipes Extender (the DOSNP.EXE file), and the NetWare DOS Requester software.

Procedure

Add the following lines, in the given order , to the STARTNET.BAT file to load the DOSNP.EXE and NetWare Client files: cdpathlslodi_lan_driveripxodi vlm dosnp 

Replace path with the directory where the DOSNP.EXE and NET.CFG files are found.
The DOSNP.EXE file cannot execute unless it can access the NET.CFG file in the proper directory path.

Replace odi_lan_driver with the name of the ODI LAN driver that your client workstation is using.

When a Named Pipes client workstation is configured for default mode, DOSNP.EXE uses the NetWare DOS Requester to search for the table of Named Pipes servers.
This requires that the BIND.VLM file be loaded.
If a Named Pipes client workstation is configured for peer mode, then the NetWare DOS Requester is not required to establish a connection to a Named Pipes server.

(Conditional) If you are running an SQL server program, add the following line for the Microsoft Named Pipe Net Library file after the entry for the VLM.EXE file: dbmmpipe 

Ensure that this file is loading only in the STARTNET.BAT file.

If you are running DOSNP on an MS Windows client workstation, do not load the IPXODI or DOSNP files into high memory.
Also, you do not need to load the DBNMPIPE file.
The DBNMP3.DLL file supports the function in MS Windows.
If you need to run an MS-DOS SQL server program from an MS Windows MS-DOS session, load the DBNMPIPE file in that session.

Save your changes and exit the ASCII text editor.

Modifying the NET.CFG File

The DOS Named Pipes Extender (the DOSNP.EXE file) allows you to specify variables for the following parameters in your NET.CFG file:

- NP MAX COMM BUFFERS
- NP MAX MACHINE NAMES
- NP MAX OPEN NAMED PIPES
- NP MAX SESSIONS BUFFERS

See "Named Pipes Option" in Chapter 2 of NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for details on how to configure for Named Pipes support.

The Named Pipes parameters in the NET.CFG file should be left-justified.

Configure parameters for the DOSNP software by following the following procedure.

Procedure

Open your NET.CFG file with an ASCII text editor.

For example, to use the Novell DOS 7 System Editor at the command line to edit the NET.CFG file in the NetWare Client directory (the default is C:\NWCLIENT), you would type EDIT C:\NWCLIENT\NET.CFG 

Make the necessary configuration changes for your particular client-server application.

See the manufacturer's documentation for information.

If you need more than the default four simultaneous Named Pipes connections on a client workstation, add the following line to the file: np max open named pipes number 
Replace number with the total number of Named Pipes that can be opened.
The range is 4 through 128.

If you need other than the default six communication buffers that the Named Pipes Extender uses, add the following line to the file: np max com buffers number 
Replace number with the maximum number of buffers that can be used.
The range is 4 through 40.

If you need to configure client workstations for the Named Pipes peer mode, add the following line to the file: np max machine names number 
Replace number with the total number of Named Pipes servers that are maintained in a table at each client workstation.
The range is 4 through 50.
This parameter is disabled by deleting the line in the NET.CFG file.

If you need more than the default ten sessions open to a Named Pipes servers at one time, add the following line to the file: np max sessions number 
Replace number with the total number of Named Pipes servers that can be communicated with at one time.
The range is 4 through 50.

Save your changes and exit the NET.CFG file.

Loading the Named Pipes Extender

Loading the DOSNP.EXE file for a NetWare connection to a Named Pipes server requires you to complete the following procedure. 

Procedure

Ensure that your Named Pipes server and client-server applications are set up properly.

See "Installing a Named Pipes Server and Client-Server Application" on page 263 for more information.

Introduction

The Novell Target Service Agent (TSA) software (the TSASMS.COM file) is a program that processes data moving between a specific target and Storage Management Services (SMS) applications such as the NetWare SBACKUP utility or the NetWare Navigator TM program. 

An SMS TM architecture-based application running on the server sends requests to the TSA software.
The TSA software performs the following functions:

- Receives commands from the SMS application and translates those commands into data requests for the local operating system to handle

- Transfers the data requests to the local operating system 

- Retrieves the requested data from the local operating system and returns it to the SMS application in standard SMS format 


The Novell TSA software has the following features:

- Operates as a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program

NetWare Client support for the TSA software (the TSASMS.COM file) must be set up on each client workstation that you want managed by an SMS application.

The complete setup for client workstations using TSA software requires you to complete the following tasks:

- Installing an SMS Application 
- Installing the TSASMS.COM and NetWare Client Files 
- Modifying the DOS System and NetWare Client Configuration Files 

Installing an SMS Application

You need to install and load an SMS application on a server or host before setting up and configuring client workstations to be managed.

See the documentation provided with the application for information on installation and setup.

Installing the TSASMS.COM and NetWare Client Files

Copying the Files to the NetWare Client Directory Automatically 

The TSASMS.COM file is automatically copied to the NetWare« Client TM directory when you run the NetWare Client installation software.

See Chapter 5, "Installing or Upgrading NetWare Client Software," on page 89 for more information.

Copying the Files to the NetWare Client Directory Manually

If you choose to not run the NetWare Client installation software, you must manually copy the TSASMS.COM and other client files to the NetWare Client directory.

To manually copy the TSASMS.COM file and other client files from the NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows diskettes, complete the following steps.

Procedure

Expand and copy the following files from the NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows diskettes to the NetWare Client directory (the default is C:\NWCLIENT).

Repeat Step 1 until the TSASMS.COM and NetWare Client files exist in the NetWare Client directory.

Modifying the DOS System and NetWare Client Configuration Files

Modifying the DOS system and NetWare Client configuration files requires you to edit the CONFIG.SYS, STARTNET.BAT, and NET.CFG files with an ASCII text editor.

Modifying the CONFIG.SYS File

Modify the CONFIG.SYS file with an ASCII text editor to set the LASTDRIVE variable to Z for the NetWare DOS Requester TM software.

Procedure

Open the CONFIG.SYS file with an ASCII text editor.

For example, to use the Novell DOS 7 System Editor at the command line to edit the CONFIG.SYS file in the root directory, type EDIT C:\CONFIG.SYS 

Set the LASTDRIVE variable to Z by adding the following line to the file: LASTDRIVE = Z 

Save your changes and exit the ASCII text editor.

Modifying the STARTNET.BAT File

Modify the STARTNET.BAT file with an ASCII text editor to load the Link Support Layer TM (the LSL.COM file), the ODI TM LAN driver, the TSA software (the TSASMS.COM file), and the NetWare DOS Requester software.

Procedure

Add the following lines, in the given order , to the STARTNET.BAT file to load the TSASMS.COM and NetWare Client files: cdpathlslodi_lan_driveripxodi vlm tsasms 

Replace path with the directory where the TSASMS.COM and NET.CFG files are found.
The TSASMS.COM file cannot execute unless it can access the NET.CFG file in the proper directory path. 

Replace odi_lan_driver with the name of the ODI LAN driver that your workstation is using.

You can use command line parameters in the STARTNET.BAT file to override NET.CFG parameters.
See Chapter 3, "Command Line Parameters Reference," in NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for more information.

Save your changes and exit the ASCII text editor

Modifying the NET.CFG File

The TSA software (the TSASMS.COM file) allows you to specify variables for the following parameters in your NET.CFG file: 

- DISK BUFFERS
- DRIVES
- PASSWORD
- STACK SIZE
- TSA SERVER NAME
- WORKSTATION NAME

See "NetWare DOS TSA Option" in Chapter 2 of NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for details on how to configure for the TSA software.

Configure the parameters for the Novell TSA software by completing the following procedure.

Procedure

Open your NET.CFG file with an ASCII text editor.

For example, to use the Novell DOS 7 System Editor at the command line to edit the NET.CFG file in the NetWare Client directory (the default is C:\NWCLIENT), you would type EDIT C:\NWCLIENT\NET.CFG 

Make the necessary configurations for your particular SMS application.

See the manufacturer's documentation for information.

Save your changes and exit the NET.CFG file.

You can use command line parameters in place of NET.CFG parameters to configure settings for your client workstations.

Introduction

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an industry-standard protocol that specifies a format for collecting network management data.

With the Novell«Desktop SNMP services, NetWare client workstations are able to send status information to an SNMP management program running on an IPX TM or TCP/IP network.

Desktop SNMP services can be managed from the Novell NetWare Management System TM (NMS) software, from other industry-standard SNMP management consoles, or from other third-party management systems.

NetWare Client support for Desktop SNMP on NetWare client workstations must be set up on each client workstation that you want managed by an SNMP-based management system.

The complete setup for a Desktop SNMP client workstation requires you to complete the following tasks:

- Installing an SNMP Management System Console
- Installing the Desktop SNMP Software
- Modifying DOS System and NetWare Client Configuration Files
- Configuring the HRMIB.INI File 

Installing an SNMP Management System Console

The Desktop SNMP services provided with the NetWare Client TM for DOS and MS Windows supports the Novell NetWare Management System software (NMS), other industry-standard SNMP management consoles, or other third-party management systems.

See the documentation provided with these managements systems for information on installation and setup.

Installing the Desktop SNMP Software

The Desktop SNMP software includes a collection of files that support the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) using the NetWare Virtual Loadable Module TM (VLM) technology.

Support for the Internet Packet Exchange TM (IPX) transport and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) transports is also provided.

Desktop SNMP and Management Information Base (MIB) Support Files 
The Desktop SNMP VLM TM programs let remote network management systems monitor the IPX TM or UDP/IP protocol stack running on client workstations.
Desktop SNMP also allows remote and local SNMP client workstations complete access to the Management Information Base (MIB) for managing workstation resources.
Desktop SNMP supports the following three MIB-II groups:

- System and SNMP groups
- Interfaces groups
- TCP/IP groups. The following files must exist in the NetWare Client directory for each client workstation.


Table

File .
Description .


HRMIB.EXE .
The Host Resources manager, which collects information about client workstations that are running DOS on the network.


HRMIB.INI .
The configuration file for the HRMIB.EXE file .


MIB2IF.VLM.
The MIB-II interfaces groups support.


MIB2PROT.VLM .
The MIB-II TCP/IP groups support.


WSASN1.VLM .
The ASN.1 translation module.


WSDRVPRN.VLM .
The print information collection file for gathering information about print mappings and captured printers .


WSREG.VLM .
The registration module .


WSSNMP.VLM .
The Desktop SNMP module, which includes MIB-II System and SNMP groups support .


WSTRAP.VLM .
The trapmodule.


These files are automatically copied to the NetWare directory when you run the NetWare Client installation program.
See Chapter 5, "Installing or Upgrading NetWare Client Software," on page 89 for more information.
The files with a .VLM extension are loaded by the VLM manager (the VLM.EXE file) using the VLM= parameter in the NET.CFG file.

The files with an .EXE extension are loaded from the command line or from a DOS batch file.

Transport Providers
The Novell Desktop SNMP requires one of the following two files in the NetWare Client directory to manage your client workstation address for the IPX transport protocol or for the UDP/IP transport protocol:

Table

File.
Description.


STPUDP.COM.
The transport provider module for the UDP/IP protocol.


STPIPX.COM.
The transport provider module for the IPX protocol .


These files are loaded from the command line or from a DOS batch file.
Both files can be loaded into memory at the same time.

Copying the Necessary Files to the NetWare Client Directory Manually

If you choose to not run the NetWare Client installation program, you must manually copy the appropriate files to the NetWare Client directory.

To manually copy the files from the NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows diskettes, complete the following procedure.

Procedure

Expand and copy the following files from the NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Disk 2 to the NetWare Client directory (the default is C:\NWCLIENT).

Table

To expand a file, type NWUNPACKsource_drive:path \filenamedestination_drive:path\filename .


For example, to expand the WSSNMP.VLM file, you could type NWUNPACK A:WSSNMP.VL_ C:\NWCLIENT\WSSNMP.VLM .


Repeat Step 1 until all the Desktop SNMP and NetWare Client files exist in the NetWare Client directory.

Modifying DOS System and NetWare Client Configuration Files

Modifying the DOS system and NetWare Client configuration files requires you to edit the CONFIG.SYS, STARTNET.BAT, and NET.CFG files with an ASCII text editor.

Modifying the CONFIG.SYS File

Modify the CONFIG.SYS file with an ASCII text editor to set the LASTDRIVE variable to Z for the NetWare DOS Requester TM software.

Procedure

Open the CONFIG.SYS file in an ASCII text editor.

For example, to use the Novell DOS TM 7 System Editor at the command line to edit the CONFIG.SYS file in the root directory, you would type EDIT C:\CONFIG.SYS 

Set the LASTDRIVE variable to Z by adding the following line to the file: LASTDRIVE = Z 

Save your changes and exit the ASCII text editor.

Modifying the STARTNET.BAT File

The following modifications to the STARTNET.BAT file are required for each client workstation that you want to load the Desktop SNMP software on.

- Modify the STARTNET.BAT file to load either one or both of the STPIPX.COM and STPUDP.COM files.

- Modify the STARTNET.BAT file to load the HRMIB.EXE file.
You must have either the IPX or UDP/IP protocol installed on your system to support the transport providers.
You can use both types of transport on a single client workstation.


By default, Desktop SNMP services are not enabled when you install the NetWare Client software.
To enable Desktop SNMP services, complete the following procedure.

Procedure

Modify the C:\NWCLIENT\STARTNET.BAT file to load the Desktop SNMP transport files.

Add the following commands in the STARTNET.BAT file after the line that loads the VLM.EXE file:

- If you are using IPX transport, add stpipx 

- If you are using UDP/IP transport, add stpudp 
You can add both commands if you use both IPX and UDP/IP transport.


Modify the C:\NWCLIENT\STARTNET.BAT file to load the MIB file.

Add the following command in the STARTNET.BAT file after the line that loads the VLM.EXE file: hrmib.exe 

Ensure that the HRMIB.INI file exists in the same directory as the HRMIB.EXE file does.

If you are running LAN Workplace, make sure you do not load the SNMP.EXE file provided with the LAN Workplace package.

The installation program for LAN Workplace creates a file called LANWP.BAT that loads the LAN Workplace software.
Check this file for a line reading SNMP.
It would be listed directly following the line TCPIP.
If the SNMP line is present, delete it or comment it out.

Add the following DOS SET command in the STARTNET.BAT file to set the correct time zone for your area: set tz =time_zone 

Refer to your DOS manual for the exact syntax for your particular time zone.

If the time zone is not set in your workstation's environment, traps for SNMP might report an incorrect time.

Save and exit.

Modifying the NET.CFG File

The following modifications to the NET.CFG file are required for each client workstation that you want to load the Desktop SNMP software on.

- Add the necessary lines in the NET.CFG file to load and support the Desktop SNMP software.

- Set the "TRAP TARGET" address of the NetWare Services Management (NSM) consoles or other SNMP-based managers.


See "Sample NET.CFG File for Desktop SNMP Services" on page 289 for an example.

By default, Desktop SNMP services are not enabled when you install the NetWare Client software.
To enable Desktop SNMP services, complete the following procedure.

Procedure

Ensure that the Desktop SNMP files are copied to the NetWare Client directory (the default is C:\NWCLIENT).

Modify the NET.CFG file to load the Desktop SNMP .VLM files. 

To load the Desktop SNMP .VLM file suite, modify the NET.CFG file on your client workstation in either of the following two ways:

- To load the Desktop SNMP and the NetWare DOS Requester software, add the following lines to the NET.CFG file in the order given : netware dos requester vlm =wssnmp.vlm vlm = wstrap.vlm vlm = wsreg.vlm vlm = wsasn1.vlm vlm= mib2if.vlm vlm = wsdrvprn.vlm vlm = mib2prot.vlm .

- To load only Desktop SNMP, without the NetWare DOS Requester modules, add the following lines to the NET.CFG file in the order given : netware dos requester use defaults = off vlm = wssnmp.vlm vlm = wstrap.vlm vlm = wsreg.vlm vlm = wsasn1.vlm vlm = mib2if.vlm vlm = wsdrvprn.vlm vlm = mib2prot.vlm 


See the following sections in Chapter 2, "NetWare DOS Requester Option," in NetWare Client for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference for details on how to configure for Desktop SNMP:

- "Asynchronous timeout"
- "Community names"
- "MIB-II support"
- "Transport providers"

After you have completed the initial configuration of the Desktop SNMP agent, you can further modify the Desktop SNMP options in the NET.CFG file to meet your specific network requirements. 

Sample NET.CFG File for Desktop SNMP Services

Following is a sample of the NET.CFG for Desktop SNMP services: 

link driver ne2000 port 300 int 3 frame ethernet_802.2 mem d0000 netware dos requester vlm = wssnmp.vlm vlm =wstrap.vlm vlm = wsreg.vlm vlm = wsasn1.vlm vlm = mib2if.vlm vlm = wsdrvprn.vlm vlm = mib2prot.vlm desktop snmp enable monitor community = any monitor community = "public" enable control community = specific control community = "public" enable trap community = specific trap community = "public" sysname = "Suzanne Morley x893"syslocation = "Building 2" syscontact = "suzanne@acompany.com" snmpenableauthentraps = on xxx xxx 

Configuring the HRMIB.INI File

The Host Resources MIB does not return information about devices attached to the host workstation, such as printers, modems, and tape drives.

If the network management console is to view details of such devices, you must list them in the HRMIB.INI file.
Use a ASCII text editor to enter a short description of each device.

The HRMIB.INI file is located in the NetWare Client directory (the default is C:\NWCLIENT).

Sample Configuration File (HRMIB.INI) for the HRMIB.EXE File

The following is a sample of the HRMIB.INI configuration file for HRMIB.EXE:

&num; List of all printers connected to host &lsqb;printers&rsqb; HP LaserJet IIIp on LPT1: NEC P20 on LPT2: &num; List of all modems connected to host &lsqb;modems&rsqb; Hayes Optima 144 on COM1: &num; List of all tape drives connected to host &lsqb;tapes&rsqb;Colorado DJ10 HP 35480A SCSI DAT
