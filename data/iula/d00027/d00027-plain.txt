In the process of regaining their democratic freedom the people of Catalonia also recover their institutions of self-government. 

Catalonia, exercising the right to self-government which the Constitution recognizes and guarantees to all the nationalities and regions of which Spain is composed, manifests its desire to constitute a Self-Governing Community.

At this solemn moment in time when Catalonia regains its freedom, tribute must be paid to the men and women who have helped to make this possible.

This Statute is the expression of the collective identity of Catalonia and defines its institutions and relations with the State within a framework of free solidarity with the other nationalities and regions of Spain.
This solidarity is the guarantee of the genuine unity of all the peoples of Spain.

The Catalan people proclaim freedom, justice and equality to be the supreme values of their collective life and express their desire to advance along a path of progress which will ensure a decent standard of living for all who live and work in Catalonia. 

The collective freedom of Catalonia finds in the institutions of the " Generalitat " a link with a long history of emphasis on and respect for the fundamental rights and public freedoms of individuals and peoples: a history which the people of Catalonia wish to continue, in order to make possible the creation of a forward-looking democratic society.

5. Public officials attached to services under State ownership or other public institutions who are affected by the transfers to the " Generalitat " shall become subject to the latter.
All rights of any rank or kind which they possess at the time of the transfer shall be respected, including the right to take part in the transfer examinations organized by the State on equal terms with the other members of their corps, thus exercising their permanent right of choice. 

Until such time as the " Generalitat " approves the Statute of its own officials, the current provisions of the State on this subject shall be applied.

6. The " Generalitat " shall automatically and definitively assume those services, without any break in continuity, which have already been transferred to it from September 29th, 1977, until the coming into force of this Statute.
As regards those powers whose transfer is in the process of being implemented, the procedure shall be continued in accordance with the terms established by the corresponding transfer decree.
In either case, the transfers carried out shall be adapted if necessary, to the terms of this Statute.

7. The Provincial Councils (" Diputacions ") of Barcelona, Girona, Lleida and Tarragona may transfer or delegate to the " Generalitat " of Catalonia all those services which by their very nature require co-ordinated planning, in accordance with the provisions on local government legislation, or may retain for themselves the implementation and management of such services.

8. The Joint Commission set up in accordance with article 3 of the Royal Decree of September 30th, 1977, shall be considered to be dissolved when the Joint Commission referred to in paragraph 1 of this Transitory Provision is set up.

Those transfers which have to be made in educational matters in order to transfer the State's services and centres in Catalonia to the jurisdiction of the " Generalitat ", shall be carried out in accordance with the schedules and programmes laid down by the Joint Commission.

As regards television, the application of paragraph 3 of article 16 of this Statute entails the State's granting the use of a third channel on a concession basis to the " Generalitat " under State ownership, which must be set up specifically for broadcasting in the territory of Catalonia, under the terms laid down in the above-mentioned concession. 

Until this new television channel actually comes into service, Spanish Radio and Television (RAVE) shall set up, through its organization in Catalonia, a temporary programme system specifically designed for the territory of Catalonia, which Spanish Television shall broadcast over the second channel (UHF).

The cost of the specific television programming referred to in the previous paragraph shall be taken as a basis for calculation of the subsidy which may be granted to the " Generalitat " during the first two years of the operation of the new channel referred to in this Transitory Provision.
