Financial system 

The Andorran banking system is governed by the recently enacted law on the Regulation of the financial system which lays down the requisites for financial bodies operating in the country.
- limitation on foreign participation in company capital,
- minimum reserves of own funds to be deposited with the Andorran National Institute for Finance,
- audits and -very important for customers- bank secret.


This law complements the self-regulating role hitherto played by the country's financial bodies.

The importance given to bank secret is worth a special mention.

It is specifically protected by the law on the protection of bank secret and the prevention of laundering of money or stocks of criminal origin and also included in the Constitution and the Criminal Code.
This law, as its name implies, forms the legal framework for preventing the laundering of money coming from drug trafficking or organized crime.

Financial activities are considerable and facilitate an extraordinary flow to Andorra of foreign capital seeking to take advantage of the zero taxation on deposits, the absence of institutional limitations on credit and the offers of loans at competitive rates.
To maintain this status, the Andorran government negotiated for and obtained from the EEC the status of third party country, thanks to which it has kept most of its privileges and significant import taxes are levied on only a very specific series of products.

Andorra does not have its own currency.
Although the state's budget is made in pesetas, the free circulation of currencies is the rule within the country, the most widely used being the peseta and the French franc.
- zero direct taxation;
- no restrictions on the movement of capital;
- bank secret protected by law;
- very strict controls on the laundering of money from organized crime.
