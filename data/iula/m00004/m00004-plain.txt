SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL CONTENT 

This specific programme fully reflects the approach embodied in the Fourth Framework Programme, applies its selection criteria and specifies its scientific and technological objectives.

Paragraph 4.B of Annex III, first activity of the abovementioned Framework Programme, is an integral part of this programme. 

This programme will be implemented in synergy between other specific programmes in the field of life sciences and technologies, as well as in such fields as Telematics, Measurement and testing, and targeted socio-economics research.

CONTENT

Health is of the highest value for every European citizen.
Health care is a first economic sector absorbing 7,25% of the GDP and creating work for more than 6 million people or 7% of the active population.
There are more than one million qualified nurses, 850 000 medical doctors in 3 million hospital beds and 0,8% of the population per day is in a hospital bed. 

Research is essential to any strategy to improve health of the citizens and the competitiveness of the health industry.
It is important to target the research towards projects of interest to the Community and consumers, and promote the transfer of research to clinical practice.

The challenge for health research is to combat the great scourges such as cancer, AIDS, cardio-vascular diseases, neuro-mental diseases and problems linked with age and handicaps.
Rising health care costs have become a concern for all EC countries, while the European citizen is demanding more and more high-quality health care.
New health technologies and health care systems are expected to face these common problems.
The development of new medicines has become more and more expensive in both time and money, mainly due to the need to satisfy increasingly complex regulatory requirements which need to be streamlined with an international context.

Certain fundamental health problems the health industry of which the competitivity must be safeguarded and improved.
Rather than adding a supplementary tone to substantial investments already made by the Member States and European industry, the Community research will bring added value by an integration action, by synergy of national efforts and by interaction of all disciplines from basic to clinical research towards problem-solving activities.

Measures intended to encourage participation of SMEs will be implemented, in particular technology stimulation measures and interactions between science parks and biomedical and health SMEs, as recommended by the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment.
With the launching of the Biomedical and Health Research Programme Biomed I within the Third Framework Programme, more than 6 000 research teams are collaborating within 400 networks designed to encourage cooperation between teams from all EC and EEA countries and between complementary disciplines, with a view to tackling health-related problems not readily solve in a narrower context.

Within the Fourth Framework Programme it is intended to go beyond concertation only and to participate in cost-sharing research where indicated only for specific task-oriented research.
There are numerous priorities to establish taking into account the large variations in national health systems, research estructures, health industries, clinical practices and therapeutic procedures.
Only those proposals with a sound scientific concept, a high likelihood of success, a clear Community added value and contributing to the health and wealth of the European citizen will be selected.

RTD ACTIVITIES PROPOSED 

The objectives on AIDS, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases; cancer; pharmaceutical research; brain research and research on the human genome will be realized by concentration of means whereas other objectives will mainly be dealt with concertation.

Research on AIDS, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases 

Important progress in the battle against AIDS has been made through concertation of AIDS research at European Community level.
Nevertheless the number of seropositives is growing.
The immuno-suppression caused by HIV in infected peope provides an opportunity for the occurrence of old diseases, already drug resistant in some areas, and for opportunistic cancers. 

In a continuously changing industrial society which is characterized by a new permeability of borders, mobility of persons, immigration and a change of social behaviours, AIDS, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases will have an impact on the health welfare and quality of life in the European Union.

- Viro-immunological research, the genetics, molecular and structural biology of HIV and its variability 
- Contribution to the development of a safe and effective vaccine against AIDS and the establishment of markers to evaluate vaccine efficiency and to follow up the evolution of disease

- Disease prevention, including the development of new specific monitoring systems to determine the distribution patterns of old and new infectious diseases, analysis of risk factors for the development of AIDS, opportunistic diseases and novel infectious agents 
- Socio-economic and health services research: requirements for caring and prevention, analysis of socio-economic consequences and forecasts in cooperation with public health research
.

Cancer research

Improvements in cancer diagnosis, therapy and prevention require integrated fundamental and clinical approaches to research.
It is particularly important to bring new advances in cellular, molecular and developmental genetics into contact with oncology and epidemiology, in order that new biological insights into the underlying causes of cancer allow for the development of novel approaches.
The study of host-tumour interaction in the context of immune response and of somatic gene therapy targeted at cancer cells are fundamental together with epidemiological studies for investigating possible causative factors in carcinogenesis.

Subjects to be pursued in the field of cancer research Molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis and metastasis, including characterization of the genes and proteins responsible.
Together with human genome research, genetic factors of cancer predisposition.

The control of normal cellular growth, differentiation and death, and abnormalities which can alter this to predispose to cancer, including the development of accurate cellular and transgenic models suitable for cancer research.

Quality of life as a parameter for treatment assessment including terminal care and rehabilitation.

Pharmaceuticals research

The general objective is the development of the scientific and technical bases required for the evaluation of new drugs, notably for the treatment of neurological, mental, immunological and viral diseases.

These actions should also underpin the activities of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and provide it, at the international level, with the research-based background necessary to achieve harmonization of technical requirements for drug development.

Research will be conducted through collaboration between industry, research centres, hospitals, univeristies, and the authorities responsible for verifying the efficacy, safety and quality of new drugs.

Reseach will be conducted mainly in the following areas:
- Pharmacotoxicology: Prevalidation research of in vitro alternative methods, possibly using human cells and tissues, and where unavoidable animal models, in the general ain of reducing, refining and replacing animal experimentation.
Preference will be given to those tests which have reached the most advanced research on these tests should ideallu provide the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods with the best candidates for proper validation studies.
The contribution of functional imaging to neuropharmacology research will also be explored.

- Pharmacovigilance: Development of systems for high performance surveillance networks for early detection of possible undesired effects of new drugs, in accord with the existing regulatory framework and with particular attention to the international harmonization efforts.
It will include research on the exposure of patients to drugs, into harmonization of diagnostic terms and criteria, approaches to assess adverse drug reactions signals, analysis of vital statistics, transnational case-control studies, transnational registers and cohort studies.

- Clinical trials: To support intra-European collaboration in large, randomized clinical trials of high scientific quality, in order to stimulate better opportunities for improved diagnostic procedures, for therapies treatments as well as for their pharmacoeconomic aspects.

Fundamental research, with its emphasis on functional studies in order to ensure that advances in genetics are used to enhance human health, will be supported.
Development of appropriate technologies and applications which contribute to that well-being of patients will be stimulated.
In particular, attempts will be made to develop somatic gene therapy where the conditions/acceptance in Europe justify a targeted effort, e.g. cystic fibrosis.

Sharing and harmonization of genetic databanks comprising European Community participation in that management of the international database of the human genome (GDB) will be promoted.
Links will be maintained with appropriate international organizations or forums (e.g. the Human Genome Organization, HUGO).

The confidentiality of any personal information collected in the course of the research must conform to the best data protection practice.
No research modifying, or seeking to modify, the genetic constitution of human beings by alteration of germ cells or of any stage of embryo development which may make these alterations hereditary, will be carried out under this programme.

- Gene mapping and genome analysis, including construction of integrated transcriptional maps; sequencing of specific chromosomal regions; exploitation of comparative approaches
- Analysis of gene function, including the improvement of techniques for gene targeting and the development of animal models, e.g. the mouse.

- Databases, including experimental data collection, storage, analysis and development of methods suitable for the achievement of any one of the abovementioned objectives.
- Technology development, including promotion of research aiming at the development of methods suitable for the achievement of any one of the abovementioned objectives
.

Research on occupational and environmental health 

The objectives are to improve the scientific knowledge needed to increase the safety and health protection of the workers in order to avoid accidents at the workplace and prevent work-related diseases and to reduce the environmental risks for the population.

- identification and control of risk factors at the workplace and quantification of the exposure with an emphasis on biological and chemical hazards in short and long-term effects.
- development of techniques of safety management, including the definition of good safety practice and the evaluation of its effectiveness in reducing morbidity.
- health education and preventive measures to reduce accidents at work and exposure to risk factors.
- the interaction between risk factors at the workplace and in the environment and the aetiology of occupation and environment related diseases
.

Research on other diseases with major socio-economic impact 

From all horizontal activities such as molecular biology, physiology, genetics, statistics, epidemiology and generic technologies, the ultimate measure stick for the European citizen is the benefit for him as an individual.
The population expects basic answers by integrationof basic and clinical research to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of these illnesses with major socio-economic impact and the around 5 000 'orphan' illnesses which can be tackled optimally at an international level.

Cardiovascular research 

In order to accelerate the pace of unravelling the physiopathological mechanisms leading to cardiovascular disease development and translate these findings into prevention and treatments, multidisciplinary research will be stimulated by combining the expertise of physicians and scientists with different backgrounds in basic and clinical cardiovascular research and in molecular genetics.

- Analysis of the cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to diseases of the heart and blood vessel including research on cardiac and vascular cell growth, injury and repair; cardiovascular-assotiated inflammation
- Development of clinically useful agents for injury or excessive growth prevention, damage limitation and repair

- Research on combined epidemiologic and long-term prevention programmes including evaluation of possible differences in risks factors, impact of the psychosocial factors on incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and the benefits of their treatment in haigh risks groups
.

Research on chronic diseases and age-related problems

In view of the social and economic importance of the management of chronic diseases specific research will be focused on auto-immune diseases and immuno-genetics, T-cell disorders and priorities to transdisciplinary, integrative research in the specific domains of chronic arthritis, diabetes mellitus, asthma and respiratory problems.

Orphan illnesses research

'Orphan illnesses are these rare diseases (some 5 000) where the subsidiarity principle is obvious.
No country in itself can afford to spend the necessary resources and case mix to implement basic and clinical research at the low number of cases occurring at national level.
Nevertheless at an EC level as well as at a general scientific level these 'exceptional' cases turn out to be quite similar and to offer exceptional experiments by nature in-depth research on the basic mechanisms of diseases and handicaps and to offer opportunities to link genetic research with biochemical and physical expression of disease.
Examples are thallassemia; inborn metabolic diseases due to defective peroxisomes, etc.
Actions will include an inventory of rare disorders and together with the section on pharmaceutical research a depository of orphan drugs for clinical research.

Public health research including health services research 

More than 110 000 deaths under age 65 from 21 common diseases would be a avoided annually, il only each European region could attain the optimal death rates reported nationally for each of those diseases.

Traditions, practices and the legal and administrative organization of public health services and systems are so varied in Memeber States as to render impractical any harmonization of services in this domain.
Howevwe, objectives of research should be to assist Member States in strengthening their coverage of public health issues, assist in the formulation and implementation of objectives, policies and strategies, and contribute to continuity of health protection provision across the European Union.

- Research on health education and prevention, primary care, asessment of health needs, including the needs of emerging dependency groups, performance measurements of health policy initiatives and the evalutaiton of health technologies
- Coordination and comparison of European health data
- The impact of the Internal Market on supply of health care across internal frontiers regulations and de-regulations as well as the balance berween health systems financed by the private and public sectors 
- Health economics and organizational aspects of health systems
- Defining a European approach for the introduction of new technologies in health sistems
.

Research on biomedical technology and engineering

Health technology assessment and prenormative research become more important in a Europear-wide market with its directives concerning medical devices and accompanying standardization activities.
For industry as well as for decision-makers at all levels to safety, it is essential to have an addition to needs for safety, timely access to objective information on efficacy and efficiency of medical devices, before introducing these on the health market. 

Research and development will be promoted mainly in the following areas:
- Minimal intervention techniques and robotics: robotics,three-dimensional imaging, micro structure technology and 'nanotechnology' to support surgical therapy, and widen the range of clinical indications for minimal medical interventions; new ergonomic approaches of the operating theatre for minimally invasive surgery
- Imaging techniques: magnetic resonance, ultrasound, biomagnetism, positron emission tomography,etc., as well as microwave imaging and near infrared spectroscopy and imaging; comparative and integrated evaluation of different biomedical imaging technologies
- Research on biosensors, especially with regard to their clinical value, as among others is the case of glucose monitoring for diabetes, oxygen monitoring and ion sensing for critical care 
- Meeting the needs of the increasing population of elderly and handicapped persons calls for more research on rehabilitation technology in coordination with the relevant parts in the Telematics Programme.
The powerful trend towards replacement in medicine requires more research in biomaterials, especially towards improved mechanical properties and biocompatibility of polymers, as well as on artificial organs, such as on artificial heart and artificial pancreas.
Research aiming at the modelling of human functions, as well as in biomechanics, haemodynamics and bio-rheoloy, is also required in that respect.

- Cellular engineering:synergistic benefits would accrue by combining cell and molecular biology with chemical, mechanical and electrical engineering, opening new possibilities for clinical applications

Research on biomedical ethics

Research on biomedical ethics, being of a horizontal nature, will address general standards for the respect of human dignity and the protection of the individual in the context of biomedical research and its clinical applications.
The social impact and the public awareness of the problems associated with biomedical progress will be addressed.

- Medically assisted procreation, including gender selection, preimplantation and prenatal diagnosis, research on embryo, use of foetal ovarian tissue, post-menopausal pregnancy, sperm and egg donation
- Human genome analysis and its clinical applications, including testing, screening and somatotherapy 
- End of life, including palliative care, euthanasia, artificial prolongation of life by advanced medical techniques, resuscitation
- Research allocation: ethical and social dimensions of the choices to be made in health budgets and resource allocation 
- Organ and tissue transplantation including the use of human organs and tissues, as well as the functioning of tissue and organ banks 
- Patient's consent: informed consent of the individual for diagnosis, therapy, prevention or research including the consent of vulnerable populations like e g. prisoners and cognitively impaired patients
- Confidentiality and privacy considering medical data, genetic and non-genetic, with an emphasis on the specific problem raised by modern information systems such as computerization with automatic data transfer
.

Objectives dealt with horizontal activities 

Research activities on biomedical ethics carried out within biomedical and health research and the activities on the ethical, legal and social aspects carried out by the horizontal unit 'legal and ethical aspects' will be performed jointly in order to benefit from interdisciplinary competences. 

In order to improve dialogue and mutual understanding between the main national, sociopolitical and bioethical positions, whilst recognizing the cultural differences which exist in Member States, working groups will be organized to prepare reports and surveys of interest also to the European Parliament and the Council.
Targeted workshops to identify and debate areas of national and international divergences and, where appropriate, research activities with multidisciplinary approaches to such topics will be carried out.
Public awareness activities on new biomedical technologies will also be funded.

This horizontal activity takes into account the European Bio-ethics Convention and its draft Protocols.

Wherever possible, experimentation and testing on animals should be replaced by in vitro or other methods.
No research modifying, or seeking to modify, the genetic constitution of human beings by alteration of germ cells or of any stage of embryo development which may make these alterations hereditary, nor research seeking to replace a nucleus of a cell of an embryo with a nucleus taken from a cell of any person, embryo or subseuent development of an embryo, known as cloning, will be carried out under any of these three Specific Programmes.

Demonstration activities within biomedical and health research will facilitate comparative European multi-centre trials of new drugs, new therapeutic approaches, and ready-for-testing prototypes of new medical devices.
Special attention will be given to demosntration of the latest technologies in clinical diganostics and imaging technologies, implantable sensors for the monitoring or rehabilitation of pathological conditions, artificial organs, biocompatible materials, new cancer therapies and irradiation technologies.
A bottom-up approach will be used, in cooperation with other life sciences programmes, to identify the best opportunities for pre-competitive demonstration, in order to prove the technical viability of these new technologies, together with, as appropiate, thir economic advantage at a pre- competitive level.
The early involvement of hospitals and clinicians in these demonstrations will allow for an afficient dissemination of knowledge and a quick realization of the benefits to be derived from the adoption into practice of such innovative approaches, drugs and devices.
While keeping as a first priority the benefits for patients, demonstration in these areas will take into account the specific needs of the biomedical engineering and pharmaceutical industries and health care delivery organizations, and will be implemented by partnerships involving these manufacturing industries, the health profession, the health-care providers and health authorities.
